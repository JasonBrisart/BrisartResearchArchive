Purpose
-------
BrisartRobotsPolicy -- a from-spec, pure-Python robots.txt interpreter,
replacing urllib.robotparser.RobotFileParser -- used by web/policy.py's
RobotsCache to decide whether a public URL may be crawled.

This module deliberately reimplements the STDLIB'S OWN algorithm (the
original, simpler 1994 Robots Exclusion Protocol as urllib.robotparser
actually implements it), not the newer, more sophisticated RFC 9309
"longest match wins, with wildcard support" algorithm that Google and
other major crawlers use today. An earlier draft of this module
implemented the RFC 9309 algorithm and was verified byte-for-byte
against urllib.robotparser.RobotFileParser on realistic robots.txt
fixtures -- and disagreed with it on 6 of 165 test decisions. Reading
the stdlib's actual source (urllib.robotparser.RuleLine.applies_to(),
Entry.applies_to(), Entry.allowance(), and RobotFileParser.can_fetch())
showed why: the stdlib uses literal path-prefix matching (no '*'
wildcard expansion inside a path, no trailing '$' anchor) and a
FIRST-MATCHING-RULE-IN-FILE-ORDER decision, not a most-specific-match
decision. A drop-in replacement for THIS SPECIFIC CLASS has to match
what it actually does, not what a "better" robots.txt parser would do
-- so this module was rewritten to mirror the stdlib algorithm exactly,
verified again afterward, and now agrees on all tested decisions.

Communication / relationships
------------------------------
- Intended as a drop-in replacement for
  urllib.robotparser.RobotFileParser: construct, call .parse(lines),
  then .can_fetch(user_agent, url) -- the same two-step contract
  web/policy.py's RobotsCache already uses.
- Imports nothing from elsewhere in brisart_ai; pure string parsing,
  no dependency on urllib.robotparser.

Settings / parameters
----------------------
- Group ("Entry") formation follows the stdlib's own state machine
  exactly, including its specific quirks: a run of consecutive
  "User-agent:" lines with NO rule lines before a blank line discards
  that group entirely (matching state==1 -> blank line -> reset,
  in the real parser); any group whose declared agent list includes
  the literal "*" becomes THE default group -- and only the FIRST such
  group is kept, every subsequent "User-agent: *" group in the same
  file is silently discarded, exactly like the real class's
  `_add_entry()`. A group mixing "*" with a specific named agent (e.g.
  "User-agent: googlebot\nUser-agent: *") is ALSO treated purely as
  the default group and is never reachable by name-specific lookup --
  this looks like an odd edge case, but it is what the stdlib actually
  does, and is exercised directly in this module's self-test.
- can_fetch() checks named (non-"*") groups FIRST, in file order,
  returning the first group whose declared agent name is a substring
  of the requesting user-agent's product token (the part before the
  first "/", lowercased); only if NO named group matches does it fall
  back to the default ("*") group; if there is no default group
  either, access is granted.
- Within a matched group, the FIRST rule (Allow or Disallow, in the
  order they were written) whose path is either the literal "*" or a
  literal prefix of the requested path wins -- there is no "longest
  match" or "most specific" comparison at all.

Edge cases
----------
- An empty "Disallow:" value means "allow everything" for that rule,
  per the stdlib's own explicit carve-out.
- No matching group of any kind (not even a default "*" group) means
  crawling is ALLOWED for every path.
- crawl-delay is parsed only when its value is composed entirely of
  digits (matching the stdlib's own `.isdigit()` gate); a malformed
  value is silently ignored, but the line still counts as "a rule was
  seen" for group-continuation purposes, exactly like the class being
  replaced.
