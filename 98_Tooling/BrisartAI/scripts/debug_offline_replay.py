"""
File: scripts/debug_offline_replay.py

Purpose
-------
Offline retrieval replay: ranks imported-document chunks with no
network involved, using controlled in-file text fixtures against the
real brisart_ai.knowledge.ranker.search() path.

Communication / relationships
------------------------------
- Imports brisart_ai.intent.{describe_intent, detect_intent},
  brisart_ai.knowledge.index.Index, brisart_ai.knowledge.ranker.search.
- Standalone script; run directly via `python3 scripts/debug_offline_replay.py`.

Settings / parameters
----------------------
- FIXTURES: (name, query, expected_top_title, chunks) tuples.
- Usage: no args (all fixtures), a fixture name, or --list.

Edge cases
----------
- Fixture database lives in a temp dir, deleted on exit.
- Exit status is non-zero when a fixture's expected top chunk doesn't win.
