"""Atomic JSON/text file writes, the single canonical copy.

Replaces the write-to-temp-then-rename dance that existed in three places
(vault_file.save_vault_file, identity_store.save_json, report_writer). Two of
them fsync the containing directory for durability; the report writer did not.
That difference is preserved as the fsync_dir flag rather than silently
unified, because a report is regenerable and a vault is not.

A reader sees either the old file or the fully-written new one, never a
half-written file: bytes land in a uniquely-named temp file that is os.replace-d
into position only after being flushed and fsync-ed.
