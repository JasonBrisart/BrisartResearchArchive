"""Generic file attachments on a biometrics identity record.

This is deliberately independent of the voice/fingerprint/video modality
system in engine/modalities.py: a modality template is always the OUTPUT
of a feature extractor run over a specific file format (WAV, PGM/PNG,
BRVID). An attachment is the RAW ORIGINAL FILE ITSELF, completely
unprocessed and un-interpreted -- any extension, no extension, any binary
content whatsoever -- sealed and later returned byte-for-byte identical to
what was attached. Nothing here ever inspects a file's name or contents to
decide how to handle it; every attachment is handled exactly the same way
regardless of what it actually is.

Sealed under the same keyring master key templates use (see
crypto.keyring and biometrics/README.md's "Storage Model" section), bound
to a context naming both the identity id and the attachment's filename
(crypto.context.attachment_context), so a sealed attachment can never be
moved to a different identity, or relabeled under a different filename,
without failing authentication -- exactly the same protection
template_context already gives modality templates.
