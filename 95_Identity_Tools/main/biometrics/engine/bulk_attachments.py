"""Chunked, multi-path bulk file/folder/drive attachments on a biometrics
identity record -- the biometrics-side counterpart to
vault.store.bulk_file_service.BulkFileService, built for exactly the same
reason: a single BSR2 envelope hard-caps at ~16 MiB
(crypto.envelope.MAX_PAYLOAD_BYTES), so a large file, or a zip built from
an entire folder/drive, must be split into several sealed chunk
attachments and reassembled on the way back out.

Manifest + chunk model: attaching a bundle under `name` actually creates
several REAL attachments on the record (via the existing
biometrics.engine.attachments.attach_bytes, unmodified) named
"{name}.manifest" (a small JSON-shaped payload describing the chunk
attachment names, order, total size, and whole-content SHA-256) and
"{name}.chunk0", "{name}.chunk1", ... in order. Nothing about an individual
chunk attachment's own storage is special -- it is a completely ordinary
sealed attachment; only the manifest naming convention ties them together.

Since biometrics attachments seal raw bytes (not JSON) via
crypto.envelope.seal_bytes/open_bytes, the manifest itself is stored as
UTF-8-encoded JSON bytes through the exact same attach_bytes/
extract_attachment_bytes path every other attachment uses -- there is no
separate "JSON attachment" concept here, keeping this module's storage
shape uniform with single-file attachments rather than introducing a
second payload format.
