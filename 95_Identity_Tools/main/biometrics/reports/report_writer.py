"""Audit-trail reports for enrollment and verification events.

Every enroll or verify action that touches an identity is worth a durable
record independent of the identity file itself: a security review of "who was
verified, when, and did it match" should not require reconstructing history
from a mutable record that only holds current state. Reports are therefore
append-style -- one JSON file per event, named with a timestamp and a short
random suffix so concurrent events never collide -- rather than one growing
log file that a partial write could corrupt.

Reports never contain sealed template bytes or feature vectors, only
identity ids, modality names, scores, and outcomes: enough to audit a
decision without re-exposing the biometric data the decision was made about.
