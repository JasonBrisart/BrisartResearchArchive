"""DRBG construction for BSR2 envelope operations.

``brisart_security_envelope.encrypt`` requires a caller-supplied generator and
deliberately does not create one. That leaves the caller responsible for seeding
it correctly, and the seed is where a deterministic generator lives or dies:
BSR2's DRBG expands seed material but cannot create entropy, so a weak seed
means weak salts and nonces no matter how good the expansion is.

This module seeds from ``secrets.token_bytes`` at double the minimum, and wraps
the generator so the DRBG's lifecycle limits (100,000 requests, 16 MiB output)
trigger a transparent reseed from fresh operating-system entropy instead of a
hard failure mid-run. Upstream raises ``BrisartDRBGError`` at those limits by
design; a long-lived enrollment process should not crash on record 100,001.
