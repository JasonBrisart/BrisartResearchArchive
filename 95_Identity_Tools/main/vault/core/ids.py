"""Record id generation and validation for the vault.

Unlike biometrics identity ids (which become filesystem path segments and so
must reject path separators), a vault record id is only ever used as a JSON
object key inside a single vault file. That is a narrower attack surface, but
the id still ends up embedded in the BSR2 context string
(:func:`crypto.context.record_context`), which rejects the ``|`` separator
and NUL bytes itself. Validation here catches those problems earlier, with a
message that names the actual field, rather than surfacing a generic context
error from deep inside the sealing call.
