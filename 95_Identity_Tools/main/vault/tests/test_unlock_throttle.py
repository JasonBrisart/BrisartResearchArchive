"""Tests for the crypto.attempt_store wiring inside
vault.store.vault_service.VaultService.unlock()/unlock_with_recovery_code().

SLOW: setUpClass() creates one real vault (VaultService.create(), which pays
BSR2's real ~85-90s KDF derivation twice -- once for the passphrase wrapper,
once for the recovery-code wrapper). Individual test methods that simulate a
LOCKED-OUT container do NOT pay any further KDF cost, because
check_and_get_state() raises before a Keyring is even constructed -- that
fast-refusal property is itself part of what this module verifies. Exactly
two test methods perform a real unlock attempt (one wrong passphrase, one
correct unlock) to confirm genuine failure/success are recorded correctly,
and one more confirms a recovery-code unlock clears a counter a prior
passphrase failure had incremented.
