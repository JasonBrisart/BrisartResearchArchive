"""Chunked, multi-path bulk file/folder/drive encryption on top of VaultService.

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS: BSR2's vendored envelope hard-caps a single sealed
payload at vendor.brisart_security_envelope.MAX_PLAINTEXT_BYTES == 16 MiB
(crypto/envelope.py's own MAX_PAYLOAD_BYTES trims that further for its
length-prefix + padding overhead). Calling encrypt() on anything larger
raises BrisartEnvelopeError outright -- no silent truncation, it simply
refuses. So "encrypt this file" only works unmodified for content under
roughly 16 MiB. Anything bigger -- a large single file, a folder, an entire
drive -- must be split into several separately-sealed chunks and reassembled
on the way back out. This module is that splitting/reassembly layer, built
once here so both Vault and Biometrics attachments can share it.

WHAT THIS MODULE DOES NOT DO: it does not stream-encrypt on the fly. A
bundle (whether one big file or a zip of many files/folders) is first fully
materialized as a real zip file on local disk via the stdlib `zipfile`
module, then read back and chunked. The practical ceiling for "encrypt my
whole drive" is therefore bounded by available local disk space for that
temporary zip and by how long walking + compressing that many files takes --
not by anything in this module's own logic, which has no size ceiling of its
own beyond chunk count (i.e. none). Encrypting a full, multi-hundred-GB drive
is technically supported but will take a genuinely long time and require that
much free disk space for the intermediate zip.

MANIFEST + CHUNK MODEL: a bulk encryption produces exactly one small manifest
record (an ordinary vault JSON record, kind BUNDLE_MANIFEST_KIND) naming how
many chunk records exist, their ordered record ids, the original total size,
and a SHA-256 of the COMPLETE reassembled plaintext (the zip bytes, before
chunking) -- so a restore can verify integrity across the whole chunk set,
not just per-chunk. Each chunk is a vault FILE record (created via
VaultService.upsert_file_bytes) sealed under kind BUNDLE_CHUNK_KIND rather
than the standalone FILE_RECORD_KIND, so its "kind" field distinguishes it as
an internal bundle piece rather than a real, independently-meaningful
standalone file record.
