"""Low-level cryptographic operations for Identity-Bound Packages.

An IBP separates the secret that protects the *payload* from the secrets
that protect *access to that secret*, the same envelope-around-a-key pattern
:mod:`crypto.keyring` uses for a single master key. Here it is generalised to
many recipients:

* A random 32-byte **content key** seals the actual payload once.
* The content key itself is sealed once per recipient, each under that
  recipient's own master key, in that recipient's own **key slot**.

Consequences that follow from this and are deliberate: adding or removing a
recipient only touches that recipient's key slot -- the payload is never
re-encrypted, and no other recipient's slot is touched. Losing every
recipient's master key makes the package permanently unopenable, by design;
there is no back door.

Named ``ciphers.py`` rather than ``crypto.py`` specifically to avoid
colliding with the top-level ``crypto/`` package this module imports from.
