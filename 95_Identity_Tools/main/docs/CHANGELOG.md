## [1.9.1] - 2026-09-12

A test-correctness follow-up to 1.9.0.

The unlock-throttling implementation forward-ported from
LTS-2028-SEC-1 and LTS-2028-SEC-2 remained correct. However, the
shared-counter Vault regression test inherited an incomplete correction
from LTS-2028-COR-1.

Version 1.9.0's regression test attempted to expire the ordinary
backoff window by resetting `locked_until` to `0.0`. This was
incorrect. `locked_until` represents the full lockout imposed after the
maximum failed-attempt threshold is reached; ordinary exponential
backoff is calculated using `failed_attempts` and `last_failure_at`.

### Fixed

**Forward-port of `LTS-2028-COR-2` (Low)**

`vault/tests/test_unlock_throttle.py` now preserves
`failed_attempts == 1` while setting `last_failure_at` to `0.0`,
making the recorded failure old enough that the ordinary backoff
interval has elapsed while keeping the shared counter intact.

The corrected test verifies that:

1. A failed passphrase increments the shared persisted counter.
2. The recovery-code path observes the same persisted state.
3. Expiring the ordinary backoff interval does not reset the counter.
4. A valid recovery-code unlock succeeds after the interval has elapsed.
5. Successful recovery-code authentication clears the shared state.

### Verification

The corrected test was validated through the real-KDF slow suite:

```text
PASS  ran 46 test(s)

Ran 46 tests in 6258.102s

OK
```

## [1.9.0] - 2026-09-12

A security-hardening release forward-porting the completed LTS-2028 unlock-throttling patch set into the Current line. This release closes missing application-layer attempt controls in the Vault and Biometrics keyring authentication paths while preserving Main's existing hardware architecture, Integrity Ledger, stored data formats, and dependency model.

The security work originated on the frozen LTS-2028 line, where the shared application architecture was corrected and verified first, then was adapted to Main without importing LTS release numbering or branch-specific history. Main remains the Current development line; the permanent LTS identifiers below are retained solely for cross-branch traceability.

### Security

- **Vault unlock throttling, forward-ported from `LTS-2028-SEC-1` (High).** `VaultService.unlock()` and `VaultService.unlock_with_recovery_code()` now consult the existing `crypto.throttle.AttemptLimiter` through the new `crypto/attempt_store.py` persistence adapter. Passphrase and recovery-code failures share one `"unlock_attempts"` counter inside `vault.json`, so switching credential types does not reset the attempt budget. A caller in an active backoff or lockout period is refused before a `Keyring` is constructed or the slow KDF is run. Failed authentication updates the persisted state; successful authentication clears it.

- **Biometrics keyring unlock throttling, forward-ported from `LTS-2028-SEC-2` (High).** The Biometrics CLI and GUI now route passphrase authentication through the new `biometrics/identity/keyring_access.py` entry point instead of calling `Keyring.unlock_with_passphrase()` independently. Both interfaces therefore enforce the same policy and persist the same `"unlock_attempts"` state inside `keyring.json`; neither interface can be used to bypass backoff or lockout established through the other.

- **Shared policy.** Both components inherit the unchanged `AttemptLimiter` defaults: five failed attempts, exponential backoff from one second to a maximum of 300 seconds, and a 900-second (15-minute) lockout after the fifth failure. This release wires the already-shipped limiter into the applicable unlock paths; it does not modify the limiter or any cryptographic primitive.

### Fixed

- **Shared-counter regression-test correction, forward-ported from `LTS-2028-COR-1` (Low).** The Vault recovery-code test now expires only the temporary `locked_until` gate while preserving `failed_attempts`, then verifies that a successful recovery-code unlock clears the same counter previously incremented by a failed passphrase attempt. The production throttling behavior was correct; the original test incorrectly attempted the recovery-code unlock while the legitimate initial backoff was still active. The corrected test is deterministic and does not use `sleep()`.

### Added

- `crypto/attempt_store.py`: a small, component-neutral persistence adapter for reading, checking, updating, and clearing `AttemptLimiter` state in caller-owned JSON containers.
- `biometrics/identity/keyring_access.py`: the single throttled Biometrics keyring-unlock entry point shared by the CLI and GUI.
- `crypto/tests/test_attempt_store.py`: focused coverage for fresh state, stable field naming, failure recording, lockout, successful clearing, shared-counter semantics, default-limiter behavior, and status inspection.
- `vault/tests/test_unlock_throttle.py`: real-KDF integration coverage for Vault passphrase and recovery-code throttling.
- `biometrics/tests/test_keyring_access.py`: real-KDF integration coverage for the shared Biometrics keyring-access path and retry messaging.

### Changed

- `vault/store/vault_service.py`: both Vault unlock methods now check persisted attempt state before keyring construction, record failures, and clear state on success. Main-only Integrity Ledger behavior and all non-unlock Vault operations remain unchanged.
- `biometrics/app.py`: CLI keyring unlocking now uses `biometrics.identity.keyring_access`.
- `gui/tabs/tab_biometrics.py`: GUI keyring unlocking now uses the same shared access function as the CLI.
- `tests/run_tests.py`: `VaultUnlockThrottleTests` and `KeyringAccessThrottleTests` are registered as slow real-KDF suites; existing Main test registrations are preserved.
- `docs/BSR2_INTEGRATION.md`, `crypto/README.md`, `vault/README.md`, and `biometrics/README.md`: documentation now describes the wired application-layer throttling behavior and its residual limits instead of presenting `AttemptLimiter` only as an available building block.

### Verification

- Confirmed that every Python file in the complete 1.9.0 working tree parses and compiles successfully.
- Confirmed all eight `crypto.tests.test_attempt_store` tests pass.
- Confirmed by syntax-tree inspection that the Biometrics CLI and GUI call only `keyring_access.unlock_with_passphrase()` and retain no direct keyring passphrase-unlock bypass.
- Confirmed both Vault unlock paths contain limiter checks, failure recording, and successful-state clearing.
- Confirmed the corrected Vault shared-counter test preserves `failed_attempts` while expiring only `locked_until`.
- Confirmed both new real-KDF test classes are registered in the slow test set.

### Compatibility and residual risk

- No existing Vault, identity, keyring, biometric-template, attachment, package, custody-chain, hardware, or Integrity Ledger format is broken. The only persisted addition is the optional plain `"unlock_attempts"` field inside the applicable Vault or keyring container. Existing files load unchanged and begin with fresh attempt state.
- No migration is required.
- No BSR2 primitive or cryptographic envelope behavior changed. This is application-layer attempt throttling only.
- The limiter state is file-based and unauthenticated. A local actor with write access to `vault.json` or `keyring.json` can edit or remove the plain `"unlock_attempts"` field. The control constrains ordinary live-interface guessing but is not a tamper-proof defense against a fully capable local actor.
- No new external dependencies were introduced. Main remains pure Python and standard-library only outside its deliberately optional, caller-supplied hardware bindings and transports.

### [1.8.0] - 2026-09-12

Extends `hardware/` (introduced in 1.7.0) with fingerprint-scanner
support and brings `hardware/cameras/onvif_camera.py` onto the same
architectural rule the rest of the subsystem already follows. Every
existing subsystem (Vault, Biometrics, Packages, Crypto) remains
untouched: nothing in `hardware/` is imported by, or wired into, any of
them. No stored vault, identity, keyring, biometric-template, attachment,
package, or custody-chain format changed. There is no data migration.

As with 1.7.0, this remains **main-only and excluded from LTS-2028 by
policy**.

**Supersedes part of 1.7.0's description**, not its shipped code: 1.7.0
described `onvif_camera.py` as connecting "all the way to the camera
itself rather than deferring to a caller-supplied binding," reasoning
that ONVIF has no OS-proprietary layer forcing a split the way PC/SC
does. That reasoning was correct, but this release changes the decision
it led to: `onvif_camera.py` is now split behind a transport contract
**for consistency with the rest of `hardware/`**, not because a
proprietary wall requires it. See `hardware/README.md`'s "Why ONVIF is
split the same way despite having no proprietary wall" for the full
reasoning. This is a breaking change to `ONVIFCamera.__init__`'s
signature — see **Changed** below.

#### Added
- **`hardware/base/onvif_transport.py`**: `ONVIFTransport`, an abstract
  two-method contract (`post`, `get`) for the one operation this project
  deliberately does not implement for cameras — opening a network
  connection and exchanging bytes with the camera itself. Mirrors the
  same boundary `pcsc_binding.py` already draws for smart-card readers.
  This project ships the contract only.
- **`hardware/base/biometric_binding.py`**: `BiometricBinding`, an
  abstract six-method contract (`open_session`, `close_session`,
  `list_devices`, `open_device`, `close_device`, `capture`) for the one
  operation this project deliberately does not implement for
  fingerprint scanners — the raw call into an OS-owned biometric
  framework (the Windows Biometric Framework/WinBio, `libfprint`/
  `fprintd` on Linux) or a vendor SDK where no OS-level framework
  exists. Unlike ONVIF, there is no open wire protocol here to fall
  back on; every real capture path goes through one of these. This
  project ships the contract only.
- **`hardware/biometric/fingerprint_scanner.py`**: a `BiometricBase`
  driver for any fingerprint scanner reachable through an
  organization-supplied `BiometricBinding`. Contains 100% of the logic
  this project can implement in pure Python — device-name matching,
  retry policy, and strict shape validation of a capture result
  (`{"width": int, "height": int, "pixels": bytes}`, flat 8-bit
  grayscale, `len(pixels) == width * height`, matching the same buffer
  convention `biometrics/codecs/image_tools.py` already uses) — with
  zero third-party packages and zero OS/SDK calls of its own. The
  constructor requires a caller-supplied `BiometricBinding` instance and
  raises `TypeError` immediately if one is not provided. A malformed
  capture result from a binding is rejected with a specific
  `DeviceConnectionError` at this boundary rather than passed downstream
  silently corrupt; "no finger presented" raises the new
  `FingerNotPresentError` rather than returning `None` or a blank
  buffer.

#### Changed
- **`hardware/cameras/onvif_camera.py`: `ONVIFCamera.__init__` now
  requires a `transport` argument (breaking change).** Previously:
  `ONVIFCamera(host, username, password, port=...)`, using
  `urllib.request` directly. Now:
  `ONVIFCamera(transport, host, username, password, port=...)`,
  raising `TypeError` immediately if `transport` is not an
  `ONVIFTransport` instance. All SOAP construction, WS-Security digest
  generation, and XML parsing are unchanged; only the two operations
  that touch the network (`post` for SOAP calls, `get` for the
  snapshot fetch) now go through `self._transport` instead of
  `urllib.request.urlopen()` directly. This file's import list no
  longer includes `urllib.request`. Existing code constructing
  `ONVIFCamera` must be updated to supply an `ONVIFTransport`
  implementation; see `hardware/README.md`, "Writing your own binding,
  transport, or driver."
- **`hardware/hardware_manager.py`: `HardwareManager.create_device()`
  now accepts and forwards arguments.** Previously:
  `create_device(self, device_name: str)`. Now:
  `create_device(self, device_name: str, *args, **kwargs)`, forwarding
  directly to the registered class's constructor. This was necessary
  because `PCSCReader`, `ONVIFCamera`, and `FingerprintScanner` all now
  require a binding/transport argument at construction — without this
  change, `HardwareManager` could only construct the zero-argument
  placeholder drivers. `HardwareManager` still never imports,
  constructs, or knows about any concrete binding/transport
  implementation.
- **`hardware/README.md`: rewritten to describe all three device
  categories under one consistent rule** ("Brisart owns protocol and
  logic; the organization deploying this software owns the literal
  connection to the outside world") instead of describing PC/SC and
  ONVIF under two different postures. Includes a new section
  explaining why ONVIF is held to the same rule despite having no
  OS-proprietary wall forcing it, updated dependency-status entries for
  `fingerprint_scanner.py`, and a `HardwareManager` usage example
  showing how a binding/transport is passed through
  `create_device(name, *args, **kwargs)`.

#### Notes
- **Dependency accounting, precisely stated, across all three real
  drivers:** `onvif_camera.py`, `pcsc_reader.py`, and
  `fingerprint_scanner.py` each import only the Python standard library
  or other `hardware/*` modules. No PyPI package, no vendored
  third-party source, and no license notice obligation is introduced
  anywhere in this subsystem.
- **The architecture is now uniform, not applied only where a wall
  forces it.** PC/SC and biometric scanners have a genuine
  OS-proprietary or vendor-SDK wall with no way around it on any
  platform; ONVIF does not, and is still split behind a transport
  contract by deliberate consistency choice. All three device
  categories in `hardware/` now follow one rule.
- Every one of the three real drivers' constructors requires its
  binding/transport object and raises `TypeError` immediately if it is
  missing or the wrong type — there is no default, no silent fallback,
  and no partially-working mode for any of them.
- None of `onvif_camera.py`, `pcsc_reader.py`, or
  `fingerprint_scanner.py` has been validated against physical hardware
  as part of this repository's own test suite. All three are correct
  against their documented protocol/contract; real-world calibration
  against specific vendor firmware and a specific organization's
  binding/transport implementation is open, in the same spirit as
  `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`'s KI-001.
- No new external dependencies were introduced anywhere in this
  project. The standing caveats are unchanged and still apply in full:
  BSR2 is unreviewed research cryptography (see
  `docs/BSR2_INTEGRATION.md`), the package custody chain is
  tamper-evident rather than a digital signature, and the video
  liveness gate remains a motion-presence check rather than general
  anti-spoofing (KI-001).

### [1.7.0] - 2026-09-12

Introduces `hardware/`, an optional device-integration layer for physical
cameras and smart card readers — the first release on **main** to diverge
from LTS-2028 in scope rather than only in patch content. Every existing
subsystem (Vault, Biometrics, Packages, Crypto) is untouched: nothing in
`hardware/` is imported by, or wired into, any of them. A checkout with
`hardware/` deleted entirely still behaves identically to one that
includes it. No stored vault, identity, keyring, biometric-template,
attachment, package, or custody-chain format changed. There is no data
migration.

As explicitly called out in 1.3.x's own release notes, this feature is
**main-only and excluded from LTS-2028 by policy**: LTS-2028 remains
feature-frozen, pure-Python, and free of any hardware or device
integration for its full support lifetime.

#### Added
- **`hardware/base/device_base.py`**: `DeviceBase`, the root abstract
  contract every device satisfies — `name` (property),
  `connect() -> bool`, `disconnect() -> None`, `health_check() -> bool`.
  Contains no vendor-specific logic of any kind.
- **`hardware/base/camera_base.py`**, **`biometric_base.py`**,
  **`reader_base.py`**: thin `DeviceBase` subclasses adding exactly one
  modality-specific abstract method each — `capture_image()`, `scan()`,
  and `read_card()` respectively.
- **`hardware/registry.py`** and **`hardware/hardware_manager.py`**: a
  plain dict-backed device registry (`register()` / `get()` /
  `list_registered()`) and `HardwareManager.create_device(name)`, the
  single entry point between the rest of this project and any
  registered driver. No driver is registered automatically; nothing
  under `hardware/` runs unless explicitly opted into.
- **`hardware/exceptions.py`**: `HardwareError`, `DeviceConnectionError`,
  `UnsupportedDeviceError` — the exception family every driver in this
  subsystem raises.
- **`hardware/cameras/onvif_camera.py`**: a real, complete `CameraBase`
  driver for any ONVIF-compliant IP camera (Axis, Hikvision, Dahua, and
  most budget IP cameras). Implements WS-Security UsernameToken auth,
  `GetCapabilities`, `GetProfiles`, `GetSnapshotUri`, and
  `GetSystemDateAndTime` as hand-built SOAP/XML using only
  `urllib.request`, `xml.etree.ElementTree`, `hashlib`, `base64`, and
  `os` from the standard library. **Zero third-party packages.** ONVIF
  is a published, vendor-neutral network standard with no OS-proprietary
  layer comparable to smart-card middleware, so this driver connects
  all the way to the camera itself rather than deferring to a
  caller-supplied binding.
- **`hardware/card_readers/pcsc_reader.py`**: a real `ReaderBase` driver
  for any PC/SC-compliant smart card reader (ACR122U, HID Omnikey,
  Identiv, and most USB/contactless readers). Contains 100% of the
  logic this project can implement in pure Python — reader-name
  matching, retry policy, `GET_UID` APDU construction, status-word
  validation, and hex encoding of the ATR/UID — with **zero third-party
  packages and zero OS calls of its own**. This file makes no `ctypes`
  call and contains no platform check anywhere in its source.
- **`hardware/base/pcsc_binding.py`**: `PCSCBinding`, an abstract
  five-method contract (`establish_context`, `release_context`,
  `list_readers`, `connect`, `disconnect`, `get_atr`, `transmit`) for the
  one operation this project deliberately does not implement: the raw
  call into an operating system's own PC/SC service (`winscard.dll` on
  Windows, `PCSC.framework` on macOS, `libpcsclite` on Linux). This
  project ships the contract only; `PCSCReader` requires a
  caller-supplied `PCSCBinding` instance at construction and raises
  `TypeError` immediately if one is not provided. Implementing that
  binding, for whichever OS(es) a deployment actually runs, is left to
  the organization deploying this software.
- **`hardware/cameras/placeholder_camera.py`**,
  **`hardware/card_readers/placeholder_reader.py`**,
  **`hardware/biometric/placeholder_biometric.py`**: zero-dependency
  reference implementations proving each `DeviceBase` contract is
  satisfiable, used for architecture testing ahead of real drivers.
- **`hardware/drivers/`**: reserved, currently empty directory for
  future low-level drivers.
- **`hardware/README.md`**: documents the device contract, the
  dependency status of every driver, and the reasoning behind the
  PC/SC binding hand-off.

#### Notes
- **Dependency accounting, precisely stated:** every file under
  `hardware/` imports only the Python standard library or other
  `hardware/*` modules. No PyPI package, no vendored third-party source,
  and no license notice obligation is introduced anywhere in this
  subsystem.
- **The one real proprietary boundary in this release is PC/SC, and
  this project stops one step short of it.** PC/SC has no path on any
  OS that avoids the operating system's own smart-card service —
  `pcsc_reader.py` contains every piece of logic that can be written
  without touching it, and defers the actual OS call to a
  `PCSCBinding` an operator supplies. ONVIF has no equivalent wall: it
  is XML over an HTTP socket, which the standard library already
  speaks completely, so `onvif_camera.py` is shipped as a complete,
  working driver.
- Neither driver has been validated against physical hardware as part
  of this repository's own test suite (no CI runner has a camera or
  card reader attached). Both are correct against their documented
  protocols; real-world calibration against specific vendor firmware
  is open, in the same spirit as `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`'s KI-001.
- A lab that never registers a driver via `hardware.registry.register()`
  is entirely unaffected by this release — `HardwareManager` and the
  registry perform no work and make no calls until something explicitly
  opts in.
- No new external dependencies were introduced anywhere in this
  project; `hardware/` keeps BrisartIdentityTools' non-hardware
  subsystems exactly as dependency-free as before. The standing
  caveats are unchanged and still apply in full: BSR2 is unreviewed
  research cryptography (see `docs/BSR2_INTEGRATION.md`), the package
  custody chain is tamper-evident rather than a digital signature, and
  the video liveness gate remains a motion-presence check rather than
  general anti-spoofing (KI-001).

---

## [1.6.0] - 2026-09-11

Adds an **Integrity Ledger**: an external, hash-chained ledger of periodic
file checkpoints, meant to narrow — not close — the "edit a sealed file,
then revert it to its original bytes before anyone checks" blind spot every
tamper-evidence mechanism already in this repository (BSR2's authentication
tag, `packages.custody`'s in-package hash chain, the external audit logs in
`vault/`, `biometrics/`, and `packages/`) shares by mathematical necessity:
all of them only ever inspect a file's *current* state. No stored vault,
identity, keyring, biometric-template, attachment, or package format
changed. There is no data migration.

### Added

- **`common/integrity_ledger.py`**: new module. `append_checkpoint()`
  records a file's SHA-256 + size into an external, hash-chained ledger
  (the same hash-chain construction `packages.custody` already uses, so the
  *ledger itself* is tamper-evident — editing, deleting, or reordering a
  past checkpoint entry is detectable via `verify_ledger()`).
  `current_status()` compares a file's current hash against its most recent
  checkpoint. `history_for_path()` and `list_tracked_paths()` inspect a
  ledger's recorded history. Depends only on `common.hashing`,
  `common.atomic_io`, and `common.timestamps` — no BSR2/crypto involvement,
  since this ledger's own integrity comes from a plain hash chain, not
  encryption.
- **`tools/integrity_checkpoint.py`**: new standalone CLI, in the same style
  as `tools/envinfo.py`. `checkpoint`, `status`, `history`, `verify`, and
  `list-tracked` subcommands, meant to be run by hand or on an OS-level
  scheduler (cron / Windows Scheduled Task) against any file this project
  produces (a `vault.json`, a biometrics `keyring.json`, a package `.json`
  file, or anything else a lab wants tracked).
- **`docs/INTEGRITY_LEDGER.md`**: new file. Explains the mechanism, states
  plainly what it does and does not detect (with a worked example of both
  the "checkpoint lands inside the tamper window" case it catches and the
  "tamper-then-revert entirely between checkpoints" case it cannot), and
  gives CLI usage and suggested cadence.
- **`common/tests/test_integrity_ledger.py`**: 20 new tests, including two
  that directly exercise the core scenario this feature exists for: a
  tamper-then-revert that straddles a checkpoint is caught
  (`test_edit_then_revert_straddling_a_checkpoint_is_caught`), and the
  honest confirmation that a tamper-then-revert entirely between two
  checkpoints is *not* caught
  (`test_edit_then_revert_entirely_between_checkpoints_is_not_caught`).

### Notes

- **This is new feature work and therefore lands on `main` only**, per the
  LTS-2028 policy documented in `docs/SECURITY.md` ("No new features ...
  are introduced into an LTS line for the life of that line"). Nothing
  about the tamper-evidence already shipped in LTS-2028 (1.3.x) is broken
  or being fixed here — BSR2's authentication tag, `packages.custody`'s hash
  chain, and every audit log already work exactly as designed, within their
  documented limits. This module adds a *new* capability (narrowing, not
  fixing, the current-state-only blind spot), which is explicitly out of
  scope for an LTS line.
- **This does not close the "edit then perfectly revert" gap; it narrows
  it, in proportion to checkpoint frequency.** A lab that never runs
  `checkpoint` gets nothing from this feature. A lab that runs it
  continuously would close the gap almost entirely, at the cost of running
  a persistent process this project deliberately does not ship. Anywhere
  in between is a genuine tradeoff between operational overhead and how
  small a tamper-then-revert window remains undetectable — stated
  explicitly in `docs/INTEGRITY_LEDGER.md` and the module's own docstring,
  the same way `biometrics/features/liveness.py`'s scope statement and
  `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`'s KI-003 entry state their own limits rather than
  implying more than they deliver.
- Added `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md` KI-004, documenting this same blind-window
  limitation as a permanent, by-design characteristic (not a defect to be
  fixed), consistent with how KI-003 already documents the bulk-encryption
  throughput ceiling.
- No new external dependencies were introduced; the project remains pure
  Python, standard-library only.

---

## [1.5.0] - 2026-09-11

Adds an inspectable, on-disk variant of the Identity-Bound Package demo,
alongside the existing in-memory-only demo. No stored vault, identity,
keyring, biometric-template, attachment, or package format changed. There
is no data migration.

### Added

- **`packages/demo.py`**: new shared module, `run_demo(save_to_disk, output_root)`,
  used by both `packages.main`'s `demo` command and
  `gui.tabs.tab_packages.PackagesTab`'s Packages tab, so the CLI and GUI demo
  paths can never drift apart from each other. Runs the exact same real
  create -> add-recipient -> open -> validate-custody cycle the original
  demo always performed.

- **CLI**: `python main.py demo --save [--output-dir DIR]` now additionally
  writes every artifact produced during the demo to a new, clearly-named
  folder (`DEMO_DO_NOT_USE_<timestamp>_<package_id>/` under
  `data/packages/demo` by default): the real `package.json`, each
  recipient's passphrase text (`alice_passphrase.txt` / `bob_passphrase.txt`),
  a formatted `custody_chain.txt`, and a `README.txt` walking through what
  happened and what to try next -- including how to hand-edit the package
  file and watch authentication correctly reject the tampered result.

- **GUI**: the Packages tab gained a second button, **"Run Demo (Save Files)"**,
  next to the existing **"Run Demo"** button. The existing button's behavior
  is completely unchanged (still in-memory only, nothing written to disk).
  The new button runs the same cycle with `save_to_disk=True` and offers to
  open the resulting folder directly in the OS file manager
  (`os.startfile` on Windows, `open`/`xdg-open` elsewhere, best-effort only).

### Notes

- **Demo keys are derived from passphrase text, not raw bytes.** Every
  existing CLI/GUI command that asks for "master key text" derives a key by
  hashing whatever text is typed (`hashlib.sha256(text)`); there is no
  existing path that accepts a raw 32-byte key directly. `run_demo()`
  therefore generates each recipient's key from a random passphrase string
  and saves that passphrase text to disk, rather than a raw key -- so a
  saved demo package can be opened immediately through the existing `open`
  command or the GUI's "Open Package..." dialog with zero changes required
  anywhere else in the codebase. Verified directly: `main.py open <saved
  package> --identity-id bob` with the saved passphrase returns the real
  decrypted payload.

- **This is the one place in the repository a master key's text-equivalent
  is ever written unwrapped to disk**, and it is deliberate and clearly
  labeled: the folder name is prefixed `DEMO_DO_NOT_USE_`, and the written
  `README.txt` states in capital letters that this is not how a real
  package's key material should ever be stored (every other key-holding
  file -- a vault, a biometrics keyring -- stores only a BSR2-wrapped key).

- Tamper-detection was re-verified against the saved output: flipping a
  single hex character in `payload.ciphertext` and reopening as bob
  correctly raises an authentication failure, exactly as it would for any
  other sealed package.

- This is new feature work and therefore lands on `main` only, per the
  LTS-2028 policy documented in `docs/SECURITY.md` ("No new features ...
  are introduced into an LTS line for the life of that line"). LTS-2028
  (1.3.x) is unaffected and its `demo` command's behavior is unchanged.

- No new external dependencies were introduced; the project remains pure
  Python, standard-library only.

---

## [1.4.0] - 2026-09-11

### Added

- Introduced a dedicated `hardware/` subsystem on the main development branch.
- Established the foundation for future hardware and device integration support.
- Added a reserved hardware integration namespace to isolate device-specific functionality from the core identity platform.
- Implemented an architecture that allows hardware functionality to be added, updated, or removed independently of the core BrisartIdentityTools codebase.
- Established a clear separation between the dependency-free identity framework and future hardware integration layers.
- Created the initial foundation for future biometric device, access-control device, and hardware adapter support.

### Architecture

- Defined the hardware subsystem as an optional extension layer that communicates with existing BrisartIdentityTools functionality rather than modifying core platform behavior.
- Preserved the existing dependency-free architecture of the core identity platform.
- Designed the hardware subsystem so future hardware support can be developed without requiring invasive changes throughout the repository.
- Established the architectural boundary that differentiates the Current (main) development line from the Long-Term Support (LTS) line.

### Notes

- No hardware devices are supported in this release.
- No hardware drivers are included in this release.
- No third-party dependencies were introduced.
- Existing identity, biometric, vault, package, and cryptographic functionality remain unchanged.
- LTS-2028 (1.3.x) remains feature-frozen and continues to exclude all hardware and device integration functionality.

## [1.3.6] - 2026-09-11

A security-hardening and bug-fix patch continuing the untrusted-input
parsing work of 1.3.3. Every biometric enroll/verify run decodes an
attacker-influenceable file (a WAV voice sample, a PGM/PNG fingerprint, a
BRVID clip) *before* any cryptography happens, so these files are the
earliest thing that touches the system. This release closes remaining
"individually-valid header fields whose product or target size is
unbounded" gaps in the codec layer. No stored vault, identity, keyring,
biometric-template, attachment, package, or custody-chain format changed.
There is no data migration; 1.3.5 data loads unchanged.

As an LTS-2028 (1.3.x) release, this remains feature-frozen, pure-Python,
and dependency-free: no new features, no hardware or device integration,
and no third-party dependencies are introduced. These are security and
correctness fixes only.

### Security

- **`biometrics/codecs/wave_tools.py`: the WAV sample rate is now bounded,
  so the duration guard can no longer be neutralized by an absurd header
  value.** `read_wave()` validated only `sample_rate <= 0` and had no upper
  bound, so the existing `frame_count > sample_rate * MAX_DURATION_SECONDS`
  ceiling could be pushed arbitrarily high by a hostile WAV declaring an
  astronomically large sample rate — the same class of bug closed for the
  BRVID container (`frame_count * width * height`) and the PNG IDAT stream
  in 1.3.3. A new `MAX_SAMPLE_RATE` ceiling is checked up front, and a WAV
  whose declared rate exceeds it is refused before any frames are read.
  A legitimate recording's real, header-declared samples still round-trip
  byte-for-byte. Regression test:
  `biometrics/tests/test_codec_and_dsp_support.py::WaveToolsTests::test_rejects_absurd_sample_rate`.

### Fixed

- **`biometrics/codecs/image_tools.py`: `resize_nearest()` and
  `crop_center()` now bound their *target* dimensions, not just the source
  image's.** `_check_image()` already refused a decoded image whose own
  width/height exceeded `MAX_DIMENSION`, but the target dimensions these two
  functions resize/crop to were only checked `>= 1`, never `<= MAX_DIMENSION`
  — so a target request larger than the supported maximum would allocate
  `target_width * target_height` bytes with no ceiling. This is not reachable
  from today's callers (the fingerprint and template paths pass fixed 64- and
  128-pixel constants), but a shared image utility should refuse an
  out-of-range target the same way it already refuses an out-of-range source.
  Both functions now raise `ImageToolsError` on a target dimension above
  `MAX_DIMENSION`. Regression test:
  `biometrics/tests/test_codec_and_dsp_support.py::ImageToolsTests::test_rejects_oversized_target_dimensions`.

- **`biometrics/codecs/video.py`: `probe()` now applies the same
  `MAX_BODY_BYTES` ceiling to `frame_count * width * height` that `decode()`
  gained in 1.3.3.** The header-only inspection path computed
  `expected_size = HEADER_STRUCT.size + frame_count * width * height` purely
  to report `size_matches_header`, so it never allocated the body and was not
  itself an allocation bug — but leaving the product unbounded here while
  `decode()` bounds it was an avoidable inconsistency. `probe()` now refuses a
  header whose implied body exceeds the ceiling, so the two entry points into
  the BRVID container agree on what a well-formed header is. Regression test:
  `biometrics/tests/test_video_support.py::VideoCodecTests::test_probe_rejects_body_over_ceiling`.

### Notes

- These fixes originate on the `LTS-2028` branch and are PR-merged into
  `main`, so both supported lines carry them: LTS-2028 (1.3.x) as a
  security-and-correctness patch, and the latest release on `main` (Current)
  through the merge. The Supported Versions table in `docs/SECURITY.md` is
  unchanged.

- This is parsing-layer and input-validation hardening only. It does **not**
  change, and does not claim to strengthen, BSR2's own cryptography — every
  wrapped master key and sealed payload is exactly as protected as it was in
  1.3.5. The standing caveats still apply in full: BSR2 is unreviewed research
  cryptography (see `docs/BSR2_INTEGRATION.md`), the package custody chain is
  tamper-evident rather than a digital signature, and the video liveness gate
  remains a motion-presence check rather than general anti-spoofing (KI-001).

- No stored format changed and no shipped module's cryptographic behavior
  changed; 1.3.5 vaults, identities, keyrings, templates, and packages load
  unchanged.

- No new external dependencies were introduced; the project remains pure
  Python, standard-library only.

---

## [1.3.5] - 2026-09-10

A small, targeted patch closing the same filename-ordering bug fixed in
1.3.3 (`biometrics/reports/report_writer.py`) and 1.3.4
(`vault/reports/audit_log.py`) — this time in the third and last sibling
audit-log module, `packages/audit.py`. No stored vault, identity, keyring,
biometric-template, attachment, package, or custody-chain format changed.
There is no data migration.

### Fixed

- **`packages/audit.py`: package audit entry filenames now use
  microsecond-precision timestamps, matching the identical fix already
  applied to `biometrics/reports/report_writer.py` in 1.3.3 and
  `vault/reports/audit_log.py` in 1.3.4.** `_entry_filename()` previously
  derived its name from `utc_now_iso().replace(":", "").replace("+", "Z")` —
  a hand-mangled, second-precision timestamp that didn't even go through the
  shared `common.timestamps.filename_timestamp()` helper — plus a 4-byte
  random suffix. Two package audit events recorded in the same second sorted
  only by that random suffix, so `list_entries()`'s documented oldest-first
  ordering guarantee did not actually hold for same-second events. This is
  more than a theoretical risk for this module specifically:
  `packages.package`'s `create_package`/`add_recipient`/`open_package`
  functions each call `audit.record_event()`, and `packages/main.py`'s own
  `demo` command runs a full create → add-recipient → open cycle in one
  process invocation — three real audit events that routinely land in the
  same wall-clock second. `_entry_filename()` now uses the filename-safe
  `common.timestamps.microsecond_timestamp()`, so a burst of package audit
  events sorts deterministically oldest-first, matching the ordering
  `vault.reports.audit_log.list_entries()` and
  `biometrics.reports.report_writer.list_reports()` already provide. The
  random suffix is retained. Regression tests:
  `packages/tests/test_package_audit.py::PackageAuditTests::test_entry_filename_uses_microsecond_precision`
  and
  `packages/tests/test_package_audit.py::PackageAuditTests::test_rapid_successive_events_sort_oldest_first_by_filename`.

### Notes

- This closes out the bug class across all three sibling audit/report-log
  modules in the repository (`biometrics/reports/report_writer.py`,
  `vault/reports/audit_log.py`, `packages/audit.py`); no other module in the
  codebase constructs a chronologically-sortable filename from a timestamp.
- This is a filename-formatting fix confined to the external package audit
  log. It does not change, and does not claim to strengthen, the in-package
  custody chain (`packages/custody.py`), BSR2's own cryptography, or any
  stored package/vault/identity format — every wrapped content key, key
  slot, and sealed payload is exactly as protected as it was in 1.3.4. The
  standing 1.3.4 caveats still apply in full: BSR2 is unreviewed research
  cryptography (see `docs/BSR2_INTEGRATION.md`), the package custody chain
  is tamper-evident rather than a digital signature, and the video liveness
  gate remains a motion-presence check rather than general anti-spoofing
  (KI-001).
- No stored format changed and no shipped module's cryptographic behavior
  changed; 1.3.4 vaults, identities, keyrings, templates, and packages load
  unchanged.
- No new external dependencies were introduced; the project remains pure
  Python, standard-library only.

---

## [1.3.4] - 2026-09-10

A small, targeted patch closing a filename-ordering inconsistency between the
Vault and Biometrics audit trails. No stored vault, identity, keyring,
biometric-template, attachment, package, or custody-chain format changed.
There is no data migration.

### Fixed

- **`vault/reports/audit_log.py`: audit entry filenames now use
  microsecond-precision timestamps, matching the identical fix already
  applied to `biometrics/reports/report_writer.py` in 1.3.3.** `_entry_filename()`
  derived its name from a second-precision `utc_now_iso()` plus a 4-byte
  random suffix, so two vault audit events recorded in the same second (a
  batch upsert, or several records created back-to-back) sorted only by that
  random suffix — `list_entries()`'s documented oldest-first ordering
  guarantee did not actually hold for same-second events, even though the
  identical class of bug had already been fixed on the biometrics side in
  1.3.3 (`f78cade801`, "Harden parsing of untrusted biometric inputs" cycle).
  `_entry_filename()` now uses the filename-safe
  `common.timestamps.microsecond_timestamp()`, so a burst of vault events
  sorts deterministically oldest-first, matching the ordering
  `biometrics.reports.report_writer.list_reports()` already provides. The
  random suffix is retained. Regression tests:
  `vault/tests/test_audit_log.py::VaultAuditLogTests::test_entry_filename_uses_microsecond_precision`
  and
  `vault/tests/test_audit_log.py::VaultAuditLogTests::test_rapid_successive_events_sort_oldest_first_by_filename`.

### Notes

- This is a filename-formatting fix confined to the audit-log layer. It does
  not change, and does not claim to strengthen, BSR2's own cryptography, the
  vault record schema, or any stored payload — every wrapped master key and
  sealed record is exactly as protected as it was in 1.3.3. The standing
  1.3.3 caveats still apply in full: BSR2 is unreviewed research cryptography
  (see `docs/BSR2_INTEGRATION.md`), the video liveness gate is a
  motion-presence check rather than general anti-spoofing (KI-001), and the
  bulk file/folder/drive throughput ceiling remains an inherent property of
  pure-Python BSR2 (KI-003).

- No stored format changed and no shipped module's cryptographic behavior
  changed; 1.3.3 vaults, identities, keyrings, templates, and packages load
  unchanged.
  
- No new external dependencies were introduced; the project remains pure
  Python, standard-library only.

---

## [1.3.3] - 2026-09-09

A security-hardening and bug-fix patch on the **untrusted-input parsing
surface**. Every biometric enroll/verify run decodes an attacker-influenceable
file (a PNG fingerprint image, a BRVID clip) *before* any cryptography happens,
so a malformed or hostile file is the earliest thing that touches this system.
This release closes a genuine decompression-bomb in the PNG decoder and tightens
several header-validation and input-bound paths around it. No stored vault,
identity, keyring, biometric-template, attachment, package, or custody-chain
format changed. There is no data migration; 1.3.2 data loads unchanged.

### Security

- **`biometrics/codecs/png.py`: the IDAT stream is no longer decompressed
  without a size ceiling (decompression-bomb fix).** `decode()` previously
  called `zlib.decompress(b"".join(idat_parts))` with no bound on the size of
  the decompressed result, so a small, well-formed grayscale PNG whose IDAT
  expands to an enormous scanline buffer — a classic decompression bomb,
  reachable through any decoded `--fingerprint` image — could drive an
  unbounded allocation on the machine doing enrollment or verification. The
  exact size of the decompressed scanline data is fully determined by the
  already-validated IHDR dimensions (one filter byte plus `width` pixel bytes
  per row, `height` rows), so decompression is now performed through
  `zlib.decompressobj()` capped at exactly that ceiling and **refused** if the
  stream would expand past it, before the oversized buffer can be
  materialised. A valid image's real, header-declared scanline data still
  round-trips byte-for-byte. Regression test:
  `biometrics/tests/test_codec_and_dsp_support.py::PngRoundTripTests::test_rejects_decompression_bomb`.

### Fixed

- **`biometrics/codecs/video.py`: `frame_count * width * height` is now bounded
  before any frame slicing.** `decode()` bounded `frame_count`, `width`, and
  `height` individually (`MAX_FRAME_COUNT`, `MAX_DIMENSION`) but not their
  *product*, so a header sitting at each individual maximum implied a body far
  larger than any real clip. A new `MAX_BODY_BYTES` ceiling is checked against
  `frame_count * width * height` up front, so a corrupt-but-individually-valid
  header is refused based on the header alone, before the body length check.
  Regression test:
  `biometrics/tests/test_video_support.py::VideoCodecTests::test_rejects_body_over_ceiling_before_slicing`.

- **`biometrics/codecs/image_tools.py`: `block_grid_means()` no longer returns a
  silently wrong result for a `grid_size` larger than the image.** When
  `grid_size` exceeded `width` or `height`, `_partition()` produced
  zero-width/zero-height blocks whose `count` was `0`, and the
  `total / count if count else 0.0` guard quietly substituted `0.0` — yielding a
  feature vector that looked valid but was meaningless. `block_grid_means()` now
  rejects a `grid_size` larger than either dimension with an `ImageToolsError`,
  so a misconfigured extractor fails loudly instead of producing a degenerate
  template. Regression test:
  `test_codec_and_dsp_support.py::ImageToolsTests::test_block_grid_means_rejects_oversized_grid`.

- **`vault/app.py`: `encrypt-paths --chunk-mb` is now bounded so a caller cannot
  request a chunk size at or above BSR2's single-envelope limit.** The chunk
  size was passed straight through to `BulkFileService` with no upper bound; a
  value of 16 or more produces chunks that BSR2's envelope refuses to seal
  (`MAX_PLAINTEXT_BYTES` ≈ 16 MiB), failing the whole operation partway through
  with a confusing envelope error rather than a clear argument error.
  `--chunk-mb` is now validated to `1..15` (new `MAX_CHUNK_MB`) and rejected
  with a plain message otherwise, before any work is done.

- **`biometrics/reports/report_writer.py`: report filenames now use
  microsecond precision.** `_report_filename()` derived its name from a
  second-precision `utc_now_iso()` plus a 4-byte random suffix, so two events in
  the same second sorted only by that random suffix. It now uses the
  filename-safe `common.timestamps.microsecond_timestamp()`, so a burst of
  enroll/verify events sorts deterministically oldest-first in `list_reports()`,
  matching the ordering guarantee its docstring already states. The random
  suffix is retained.

### Added

- **`biometrics/tests/test_codec_and_dsp_support.py`**: new regression cases for
  the PNG decompression-bomb ceiling (a small PNG whose IDAT would inflate past
  its own IHDR dimensions is rejected) and the oversized-`grid_size`
  `ImageToolsError`.
- **`biometrics/tests/test_video_support.py`**: new regression case for the
  BRVID `frame_count * width * height` body-size ceiling.

### Notes

- This is parsing-layer and input-validation hardening only. It does **not**
  change, and does not claim to strengthen, BSR2's own cryptography — every
  wrapped master key and sealed payload is exactly as protected by BSR2 as it
  was in 1.3.2. The standing 1.3.2 caveats still apply in full: BSR2 is
  unreviewed research cryptography (see `docs/BSR2_INTEGRATION.md`), the package
  custody chain is tamper-evident rather than a digital signature, the video
  liveness gate is a motion-presence check rather than general anti-spoofing
  (KI-001), and losing both a vault's passphrase and its recovery code is
  unrecoverable by design.

- No stored format changed and no shipped module's cryptographic behavior
  changed; the fixes are confined to how malformed or hostile *input* is
  detected and refused at the earliest possible boundary.

- No new external dependencies were introduced; the project remains pure
  Python, standard-library only.

## [1.3.2] - 2026-09-08

A security-hardening patch closing a doc/code mismatch: `docs/BSR2_INTEGRATION.md`
and `biometrics/README.md` both claimed that files holding a BSR2-wrapped master
key are "created on first use with mode 0600 ... and the loader warns if the mode
is later widened." That protection did not actually exist in the code. No stored
vault, identity, keyring, biometric-template, attachment, package, or
custody-chain format changed. There is no data migration.

### Security

- **`vault.json` and the biometrics `keyring.json` are now written with
  owner-only (0600) permissions on POSIX platforms, and widened permissions are
  now flagged.** Both files hold a BSR2-wrapped master key -- `vault.json`'s
  `keyring` section, and the standalone biometrics `keyring.json` -- but
  `vault/store/vault_file.py`'s `create_vault_file`/`save_state` and
  `biometrics/app.py`'s `_load_or_create_keyring` previously wrote them with
  whatever default permissions the process umask produced, and neither ever
  inspected permissions on load. `common/atomic_io.py`'s `atomic_write_text`/
  `atomic_write_json` gained an optional `file_mode` parameter (new constant
  `SENSITIVE_FILE_MODE = 0o600`); both call sites now request it on every
  write. A new `warn_if_permissive()` helper is called after every vault-file
  load (`vault_file.load_state`) and every keyring-file load
  (`biometrics.app._load_or_create_keyring`), printing an advisory to stderr
  if the file on disk is more permissive than 0600 -- catching a file that
  predates this fix, or one that was widened by hand afterward. Both
  `file_mode` and `warn_if_permissive` are no-ops on Windows (`os.name ==
  "nt"`), for the same reason `atomic_io._flush_directory` already no-ops
  there: `os.chmod` cannot express POSIX owner/group/other bits the way
  `SENSITIVE_FILE_MODE` intends, so enforcing it there would be a false sense
  of protection rather than a real one.

### Added

- `common/tests/test_common_utils.py`: new `AtomicIoPermissionTests` class
  covering `file_mode` (applies the requested mode; omitting it does not
  force `SENSITIVE_FILE_MODE` onto ordinary writes) and `warn_if_permissive`
  (flags an overly-open file, stays silent for a correctly-restricted or
  missing one). Skipped on Windows.

- `vault/tests/test_sealed_vault.py`: new `VaultFilePermissionTests` class
  confirming `VaultService.create` writes `vault.json` at 0600, and that a
  subsequent `upsert` re-applies 0600 even if the file was widened by hand in
  between. Skipped on Windows.

### Notes

- No stored format changed and no shipped module's cryptographic behavior
  changed; 1.3.1 vaults, identities, keyrings, templates, and packages load
  unchanged.

- This is filesystem-permission hardening only. It does not change, and does
  not claim to strengthen, BSR2's own encryption -- the wrapped master key
  inside these files is exactly as protected by BSR2 as it was in 1.3.1. The
  1.3.1 security caveats (BSR2 is unreviewed research crypto, the package
  custody chain is tamper-evident rather than a digital signature, losing
  both a vault's passphrase and recovery code is unrecoverable by design)
  are unchanged and still apply.

- On Windows (this project's primary development platform per `version.py`'s
  own git history), this patch is a no-op by design; protecting these files
  there is a filesystem/ACL concern outside what `os.chmod` can portably
  guarantee, and is intentionally not claimed here.

---

## [1.3.1] - 2026-09-07

A documentation and test-coverage release. No stored vault, identity,
keyring, biometric-template, attachment, package, or custody-chain format
changed. There is no data migration.

### Added

- **`docs/SECURITY.md`**: new file. Describes how to report a security
  vulnerability privately (GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting preferred,
  direct maintainer contact as fallback), response-time expectations, in-scope
  vs. out-of-scope components (`vendor/` is out of scope but still forwarded
  upstream), and restates the standing BSR2 research-cryptography caveat from
  `docs/BSR2_INTEGRATION.md` without softening it.

- **`docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`**: new file. Tracks open, non-trivial issues using
  a standardized bug-report template (Reported date / Severity / Environment /
  Component / Steps to Reproduce / Expected behavior / Actual behavior /
  Tried-Ruled-out / Next step). Initial entries: KI-001 (video liveness
  threshold uncalibrated against real camera hardware), KI-002 (GUI test
  coverage gap, now partially resolved by this release's new `gui/tests/`),
  and KI-003 (bulk file/folder/drive encryption's ~1.4 KB/s throughput
  ceiling, a documented BSR2 limitation rather than a defect).

- **`tools/envinfo.py`**: new standalone diagnostic script. Prints OS,
  machine/processor architecture, Python version/architecture, and Tcl/Tk
  version in one block, meant to be pasted directly into a `KNOWN_ISSUES.md`
  bug report's Environment field. Reads only OS/Python/Tk metadata; never
  modifies anything or sends data anywhere.

- **`gui/tests/test_constants.py`**: new regression tests for
  `gui.core.constants._find_repo_root()`, the repo-root bootstrap walk every
  other `gui` module depends on at import time. Covers finding the root when
  `version.py` is two levels up, one level up, when no `version.py` exists
  anywhere in the chain (graceful fallback rather than a crash), and when
  multiple `version.py` files exist at different levels (nearest one wins).
  Also covers `APP_TITLE`, `_MODALITY_FILETYPES`, and `_Cancelled`.

- **`gui/tests/test_busy.py`**: new regression tests for
  `gui.core.busy.run_in_background` and `BusyDialog` — the background-
  thread/queue contract every slow (BSR2 KDF-touching) GUI action goes
  through. Covers the success path, the error path (with and without an
  `on_error` handler), and that `work()` genuinely runs off the main thread.

- **`gui/tests/test_path_panel.py`**: new regression tests for
  `gui.widgets.path_panel.PathSelectionPanel` — the shared file/folder/drive
  picker used by both the Vault "Files / Folders / Drives" sub-tab and the
  Biometrics "File Attachments" sub-tab. Covers add/dedup/remove/clear
  behavior, first-seen ordering, and the `on_change` callback.

### Changed

- **`version.py`**: bumped `__version__` from `1.3.0` to `1.3.1`.

### Notes
- All three `gui/tests/` files use a `_HAS_DISPLAY` skip guard: they run for
  real on a machine with a working Tk display (any normal desktop) and skip
  cleanly on a headless CI runner with no display, consistent with how GUI
  tests are conventionally handled when CI doesn't provision a display.

- `gui/tabs/*.py` (the actual Vault/Biometrics/Packages tab wiring) still has
  no direct test coverage; this remains open as the "Next step" in
  `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`'s KI-002 entry.

- No new external dependencies were introduced.

---

## [1.3.0] - 2026-09-03

Re-introduces a video-modality liveness/anti-spoofing GATE, closing the gap
explicitly documented since 1.0.0 in `biometrics/README.md`'s Status section
and `docs/BSR2_INTEGRATION.md`'s Residual Risks item 7 ("there is currently
no liveness or anti-spoofing check for any modality"). This is a new
implementation built against the current BRVID video pipeline, not a
resurrection of the 0.6.0-beta AVI-based liveness code removed in the 1.0.0
restructure. No stored template format changed; existing enrolled video
templates verify unchanged.

### Added

- **`biometrics/features/liveness.py`**: new module. `assess_liveness()` measures mean absolute per-pixel frame-to-frame difference across a decoded BRVID clip and reports `is_live` against `DEFAULT_LIVENESS_THRESHOLD` (0.75). A clip built from a single repeated frame, or any clip with genuinely zero motion, scores exactly `0.0` and always fails the gate. **This is a motion-presence check, not general anti-spoofing** — it does not detect a played-back video recording, a physically-wobbled photograph, or a high-quality mask/deepfake with natural micro-motion; see the module's own docstring for the full scope statement.

- **`biometrics/engine/enrollment.py`**: `enroll_modality()`/`enroll_identity()` gained an `allow_static: bool = False` parameter. For the `video` modality only, a static clip is refused at enrollment time by default — mirroring the 0.6.0-beta design ("a photograph cannot be baked into a template and make the verification-time gate meaningless"), re-implemented against the current codebase.

- **`biometrics/engine/verification.py`**: `verify_modality()`/`verify_identity()` gained the same `allow_static` parameter. For the `video` modality only, a static probe is reported as a non-match with a populated `"liveness"` field **before** its similarity score is ever computed, rather than being scored against the stored template. Every other modality's result dict is unaffected and never gains a `"liveness"` key.

- **`biometrics/app.py`**: `enroll` and `verify` both gained a `--allow-static` flag, threaded through to the functions above. `verify`'s console output now prints `LIVENESS_FAILED` (with the measured motion energy and threshold) instead of a similarity score when the gate rejects a video probe.

- **`biometrics/tests/test_liveness.py`**: new regression tests covering zero-motion detection, the enrollment-time refusal and its override, the verification-time non-match-before-scoring behavior, and that non-video modalities are entirely unaffected.

### Notes

- Backward compatible: no change to any stored record's schema, and no change to any existing CLI flag's meaning. `--allow-static` is new and optional; omitting it preserves the exact enrollment/verification flow for every non-video modality.

- **The default threshold is calibrated only against this project's own synthetic sample generator, not a real camera.** Real-world tuning against actual video captures is unfinished and open-ended — this release delivers the mechanism (a working, tested gate with a documented override), not a validated production threshold.

- No new external dependencies were introduced.

---

## [1.2.3] - 2026-09-03

A patch release fixing a silent data-loss bug shared by the Vault and
Biometrics bulk file/folder/drive bundling paths. No stored vault,
identity, keyring, biometric-template, attachment, package, or
custody-chain format changed. There is no data migration.

### Fixed

- **A same-named standalone file added to a bulk bundle could silently overwrite another file of the same name on restore, with zero error or warning.** `vault/store/bulk_file_service.py`'s and `biometrics/engine/bulk_attachments.py`'s (hand-duplicated, per this project's existing separation between the two tools) `_build_zip_from_paths()` assigned a standalone file's archive entry name as nothing more than its own bare filename (`root_path.name`), with no check against every other archive entry name already written into the same bundle. Selecting two individual files that happen to share a filename — an ordinary thing to do, e.g. two different folders each containing their own `report.pdf` or `notes.txt`, each added to the bundle one at a time via "Add Files..." — silently wrote two zip entries under the identical name. `zipfile` permits this at write time with no error or warning of any kind. On restore, `zipfile.ZipFile.extractall()` extracts entries in archive order, and a later entry with the same name silently overwrites an earlier one already written to disk — so one of the two originally-selected files was permanently and silently dropped from the bundle. The bundle's own reported metadata (`files_bundled` count at encrypt/attach time, `files_restored` count at restore time) continued to claim full success throughout, since both files genuinely were written into and extracted from the archive; only the file actually left on disk afterward was wrong.

### Changed

- **Every archive entry name (standalone file or walked folder/drive entry) is now tracked as it is written into a bulk bundle.** New `_unique_arcname()` helper (added independently to both `vault/store/bulk_file_service.py` and `biometrics/engine/bulk_attachments.py`) disambiguates a colliding name by inserting `" (2)"`, `" (3)"`, etc. before the file's extension — the same numbering convention a filesystem itself uses when asked to keep two same-named files side by side — so nothing is silently discarded and the disambiguated names remain human-readable after restore.

### Notes

- Backward compatible: no change to any stored record's schema, any CLI flag's name or meaning, or any function's public signature. Existing bundles created before this fix restore identically to before; the fix only changes how a *new* bundle's internal archive entry names are chosen when a collision would otherwise occur.
- Verified with two real, same-named files (`report.pdf`) bundled from two different source folders in a single `encrypt-paths`/`attach-paths` call, on both the Vault and Biometrics code paths independently: before the fix, restoring the bundle produced only one `report.pdf` on disk (the other's bytes were gone with no error); after the fix, the restored folder correctly contains both `report.pdf` and `report (2).pdf`, each byte-for-byte identical to its own original source file. A third same-named addition was also verified to correctly become `report (3).pdf` rather than colliding with the already-disambiguated `report (2).pdf`.
- No new external dependencies were introduced.

## [1.2.2] - 2026-08-25

A patch release fixing a metadata-loss bug in the Vault's record summary
path. No stored vault, identity, keyring, biometric-template, attachment,
package, or custody-chain format changed. There is no data migration.

### Fixed

- **`vault/records/record_model.py`**: `public_summary()` previously returned
  only the five fields every record kind shares (`record_id`/`label`/`kind`/
  `created_at`/`updated_at`), silently dropping a file record's plaintext
  `original_filename`, `file_size_bytes`, and `file_sha256` fields (set
  directly on the record by `VaultService.upsert_file_bytes()`). Because
  `upsert_file_bytes()` manually re-merged those fields onto its own return
  value, a file's size appeared correctly immediately after encryption — but
  `VaultService.list_records()` and `get_summary()` call `public_summary()`
  directly with no such merge, so the GUI's "Files / Folders / Drives" tab
  silently blanked its Size column back to empty on every refresh, even
  though the size was sitting in the clear on disk the whole time.
  `public_summary()` now includes `original_filename`/`file_size_bytes`/
  `file_sha256` whenever present on the record, and omits them otherwise, so
  ordinary `"note"`/`"credential"` records and `"bundle-manifest"` records
  (whose size is sealed inside an encrypted payload) are summarized exactly
  as before.

### Added

- **`vault/tests/test_public_summary_file_metadata.py`**: four regression
  tests confirming a file record's size/filename/hash survive a fresh
  `list_records()` call (the actual bug), that `get_summary()` also carries
  them, that ordinary JSON records never gain these keys, and that updating
  a file record keeps its metadata current.

---

## [1.2.1] - 2026-08-25

A patch release fixing a record-kind bug in the Vault's chunked bulk file/folder/drive
encryption path. No stored vault, identity, keyring, biometric-template, attachment,
package, or custody-chain format changed. There is no data migration.

### Fixed

- **`vault/store/bulk_file_service.py`**: chunk records created by
  `BulkFileService.upsert_large_bytes()` (and therefore `upsert_paths()`) were
  previously sealed under the same `"file"` kind used by a genuinely standalone
  single-file record. This made an internal bundle chunk indistinguishable from a
  real standalone file record created directly through
  `VaultService.upsert_file`/`upsert_file_bytes`. Chunks are now sealed under the
  already-defined `BUNDLE_CHUNK_KIND` (`"bundle-chunk"`) instead, so a chunk, a
  bundle manifest, and a standalone file each carry a distinct, correct `kind`.
- **`gui/tabs/tab_vault.py`**: the "Files / Folders / Drives" list no longer shows
  internal bundle chunks as if each were its own independent encrypted file (only
  standalone files and bundle manifests are listed). The "Decrypt / Restore
  Selected..." button now checks the selected record's `kind` first: a standalone
  `"file"`-kind record is decrypted directly to disk, while any other kind (a
  bundle manifest) is restored via the existing zip-based `restore_paths()` flow.
  Previously, selecting a genuine standalone file record here always triggered the
  bundle-restore path, which assumes a JSON manifest, and failed with a confusing
  "decrypted payload is not valid JSON" error instead of decrypting the file.
- **`vault/store/vault_service.py`**: `upsert_file_bytes()`/`upsert_file()` now
  accept an optional `kind` parameter (defaults to `"file"`, unchanged for existing
  callers) so callers like `BulkFileService` can seal internal pieces under a
  distinct kind without duplicating the sealing logic.

### Added

- **`vault/tests/test_bulk_file_service.py`**: three regression tests confirming
  bundle chunks use `BUNDLE_CHUNK_KIND`, bundle manifests use
  `BUNDLE_MANIFEST_KIND`, and a standalone file record's kind is never conflated
  with either.

---

## [1.2.0] - 2026-08-25

A GUI architecture release that splits the former single-file desktop interface
into focused, folder-grouped modules. The visible Vault, Biometrics, and
Packages workflows remain in one Tkinter window, but the implementation is now
organized so the window shell, background-operation handling, reusable widgets,
and each tool tab can be maintained independently.

No stored vault, identity, keyring, biometric-template, attachment, package, or
custody-chain format changed. There is no data migration.

### Added

- **`app.py`** is now the small root-level GUI entry point. It owns only the main
  window, notebook assembly, menu bar, About dialog, and `main()`.

- **`gui/core/constants.py`** centralizes the application title, biometric
  file-type filters, cancellation sentinel, and repository-root import
  bootstrap. The root is located by walking upward to `version.py` rather than
  assuming a fixed directory depth.

- **`gui/core/busy.py`** centralizes the modal busy dialog and the shared
  background-operation runner used to keep slow KDF and encrypted-data work
  from blocking Tkinter's event loop.

- **`gui/widgets/dialogs.py`** contains reusable modal-dialog helpers instead of
  repeating dialog construction across tabs.

- **`gui/widgets/path_panel.py`** contains the shared file, folder, and drive-root
  selection panel used by bulk Vault and biometric-attachment workflows.

- **`gui/tabs/tab_vault.py`**, **`gui/tabs/tab_biometrics.py`**, and
  **`gui/tabs/tab_packages.py`** now own their respective interfaces.

### Changed

- **The desktop GUI is modular instead of monolithic.** The former
  `gui/app.py` implementation was split by responsibility. The executable shell
  now lives at the repository root as `app.py`, while reusable GUI code lives
  under `gui/core/`, `gui/widgets/`, and `gui/tabs/`.

- **The supported direct GUI launch command is now `python app.py`.** The GUI
  README and root README now document the actual root entry point and current
  file layout.

- **GUI import setup is depth-independent.** Importing
  `gui.core.constants` establishes the repository root before any tab imports
  Vault, Biometrics, or Packages modules.

- **Documentation now matches the split GUI architecture.** `README.md`,
  `gui/README.md`, and `docs/README_FULL_FILE_ENCRYPTION.md` no longer describe
  `gui/app.py` or the deleted drag-and-drop module as current files.

### Removed

- **`gui/app.py`** was removed after its responsibilities were divided between
  the root `app.py` shell and the new GUI submodules.

- **`gui/windows_dnd.py`** was removed. The 1.2.0 interface uses the shared
  Tkinter path-selection panel and standard picker dialogs.

### Notes

- The split is architectural. GUI actions still call the existing Vault,
  Biometrics, and Packages application layers; cryptography, validation,
  persistence, and identity policy were not reimplemented in the interface.

- The project remains standard-library only and does not add a GUI dependency.

- The 1.1.1 vendored-BSR2 digest-pin fix and the 1.1.0 biometric similarity fix
  remain unchanged.

- Existing security caveats remain in effect: BSR2 is unreviewed research
  cryptography, the package custody chain is tamper-evident rather than a
  digital signature, and losing both a vault passphrase and recovery code is
  unrecoverable by design.

---

## [1.1.1] - 2026-08-25

A patch fixing the digest-pin defect that shipped as a documented **Known
issue** in 1.1.0, plus the CI path and documentation that referred to the
pre-`tests/` layout. No shipped module's behavior changed, no stored format
changed, and there is nothing to migrate. With this release the full suite
(308 fast tests) passes clean.

### Fixed

- **`tests/test_bsr2_vendor_integrity.py` digest pin (the 1.1.0 Known issue) is
  resolved.** The test's `_sha256()` normalized line endings (`\r\n → \n`)
  before hashing, so on a Windows (CRLF) checkout the digest it produced could
  never match the authoritative **raw-byte** pins in `PINNED_DIGESTS`
  (`89ccae49…`, `b50b01b7…`, `93b0f72d…`, `d5ba6022…`), and
  `test_vendored_files_match_their_pinned_digests` failed even though `vendor/`
  was byte-for-byte correct. `_sha256()` now hashes the exact bytes on disk with
  **no** line-ending conversion, so it compares directly against the raw-byte
  pins. As stated in 1.1.0, the pins themselves were always correct — they are
  unchanged; only the test's hashing was wrong.

- **`run_tests.py` and `test_bsr2_vendor_integrity.py` now resolve the
  repository root robustly.** Both locate the root by walking up to the
  directory that contains both `version.py` and `vendor/`, rather than assuming
  a fixed depth. This keeps discovery, `sys.path`, and the `vendor/` lookup
  correct now that all three root-level test files live under `tests/`, and
  removes the fixed-path fragility that caused the 1.0.3 "vendored BSR2
  directory is missing" class of error.

- **CI workflow invoked the runner at its old path.** `.github/workflows/tests.yml`
  called `python run_tests.py` in the `fast` and `slow` jobs, but the runner
  moved to `tests/` in 1.1.0, so both jobs would fail at the first step. Both now
  call `python tests/run_tests.py`. The `smoke` job is unchanged.

### Changed

- **Documentation corrected to match the enforced pin.** `README.md`,
  `docs/BSR2_INTEGRATION.md`, and `vendor/README.md` still carried notes from
  the 1.0.0 window stating the vendor digest test had been "dropped" or "does
  not currently exist." Those notes are replaced with an accurate description:
  `vendor/` is pinned by `tests/test_bsr2_vendor_integrity.py`, which SHA-256s
  every vendored file against a byte-for-byte digest and fails CI on any drift,
  edit, or unpinned `.py` file. The README's test-command examples now point at
  `python tests/run_tests.py`.

### Notes

- The 1.1.0 biometric similarity fix, the `tests/` reorganization, and the
  removal of ruff are all unchanged and remain in effect; this release only
  closes the pin defect and aligns CI and docs with the shipped layout.

- The security caveats are unchanged and still apply: BSR2 is unreviewed
  research crypto, the package custody chain is tamper-evident rather than a
  digital signature, and losing both a vault's passphrase and recovery code is
  unrecoverable by design.

---

## [1.1.0] - 2026-08-25

A biometric matching-accuracy release, combined with a test-suite reorganization
and the final removal of ruff from the toolchain. No stored template format
changed and no shipped module's runtime behavior changed except the biometrics
similarity scoring described below.

### Fixed

- **All three biometric modalities (fingerprint, voice, video) used a
  similarity metric that was blind to real impostors.** `compare()` in each of
  `fingerprint_features.py`, `video_features.py`, and `voice_features.py` used
  plain cosine similarity, which measures only the *angle* between two feature
  vectors, never how far apart their actual values are. For all three of this
  project's feature spaces (fingerprint ridge-orientation + magnitude values,
  raw video pixel-brightness block-means, voice energy/band-DCT vectors), the
  vectors are mostly positive and similarly shaped regardless of whose
  biometric data they came from, so two completely different people's vectors
  still pointed in a broadly similar direction. Cosine similarity reported
  that as a near-perfect match.

  Verified directly against real generated samples (the `ci-enroll` /
  `ci-other` seeds the CLI smoke test uses), confirmed end-to-end through the
  actual CLI:

  | Modality | old cosine score (bug) | new score | threshold | result |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | fingerprint | 0.9974 | 0.6197 | 0.80 | correctly rejected |
  | voice | 0.9762 | 0.6213 | 0.85 | correctly rejected |
  | video | 0.9159 | 0.6162 | 0.75 | correctly rejected |

  A genuine self-match scored 1.0000 before and after the fix in every case,
  so real enrollments continue to verify correctly.

  Mean-centering (a Pearson-correlation-style cosine variant) was tried first
  and barely moved the impostor score: cosine similarity is fundamentally an
  angle-only metric, and this project's impostor/genuine separation lives in
  magnitude of difference, not angle, so no cosine variant was going to fix it.

### Added

- **`biometrics/features/similarity.py`** — a new shared module holding
  `distance_similarity()`: a normalized-Euclidean-distance-based score in
  `(0.0, 1.0]`, self-relative to each vector pair's own average magnitude and
  mapped through exponential decay so identical vectors score exactly `1.0`.
  All three feature modules now import this one function instead of each
  defining their own `compare()` math.

### Changed

- **`fingerprint_features.py`, `video_features.py`, `voice_features.py`** —
  each module's `compare()` is now a thin wrapper delegating to
  `distance_similarity()`. Feature extraction itself is unchanged; only the
  similarity/scoring step changed.
- **Test suite reorganized under `tests/`.** `run_tests.py`,

  `test_bsr2_vendor_integrity.py`, and `test_cli_dispatcher.py` moved from the
  repository root into `tests/`, alongside every other tool's `tests/`
  directory, for a more consistent layout. `run_tests.py`'s discovery logic
  is unaffected since it walks the whole tree by dotted module name rather
  than assuming a fixed location for these three files.

### Removed

- **ruff removed entirely.** `pyproject.toml` (which existed solely to
  configure ruff) is deleted, the `lint:` job is removed from
  `.github/workflows/tests.yml`, and the local `.ruff_cache/` is cleared.
  This project remains pure Python with zero external dependencies end to
  end, including in its dev/CI tooling.

### Known issue (not fixed in this release)

- **`tests/test_bsr2_vendor_integrity.py` still has a stale digest pin.**
  `PINNED_DIGESTS` in its current, moved location still holds the
  CRLF-normalized hash values (`89ccae49...`, `b50b01b7...`, `93b0f72d...`,
  `d5ba6022...`), which do not match what the test's own `_sha256()`
  (line-ending-normalizing) hashing produces against the actual `vendor/*.py`
  files on disk. This means `test_vendored_files_match_their_pinned_digests`
  will still fail if the suite is run as-is. This is a carry-over from
  1.0.3.1 that was diagnosed but not yet corrected in the files that shipped
  in this snapshot — flagging it explicitly rather than presenting the suite
  as fully green. Fixing it requires either updating `PINNED_DIGESTS` to
  match the test's own normalized output, or intentionally switching
  `_sha256()` to raw (non-normalized) hashing and re-pinning to match --
  a decision that was in progress but not finalized as of this release.

### Notes

- No enrolled template's stored bytes changed and no re-enrollment is
  required; the biometrics fix applies at verification time against
  templates exactly as they were already stored.

- If you have any automation or tests that assert a specific non-1.0
  similarity score for fingerprint/voice/video, those expected values will
  need updating to reflect the new distance-based scoring.

- The 1.0.3.1 security caveats are unchanged and still apply: BSR2 is
  unreviewed research crypto, the package custody chain is tamper-evident
  rather than a digital signature, and losing both a vault's passphrase and
  recovery code is unrecoverable by design.

---

## [1.0.3] - 2026-08-24

A one-line path fix to the vendored-BSR2 digest-pin test. No shipped module
changed and no stored format changed; this release only makes
`test_bsr2_vendor_integrity.py` actually find the `vendor/` directory it is
supposed to hash, so the integrity pin restored in 1.0.1 genuinely runs
instead of erroring on a wrong path.

### Fixed

- **`test_bsr2_vendor_integrity.py` looked for `vendor/` one directory too
  high.** The test computed `_VENDOR_DIR = Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent
  / "vendor"`, but the file ships at the **repository root** (next to `vendor/`),
  not under a `tests/` subdirectory, so `.parent.parent` walked up to the
  repository's *parent* folder and looked for `<parent>/vendor` — which does not
  exist. Every subtest failed with a `FileNotFoundError` / "vendored BSR2
  directory is missing" against a path like `.../GitHub/vendor` instead of
  `.../GitHub/BrisartIdentityTools/vendor`. Changed to
  `Path(__file__).resolve().parent / "vendor"` (one level up, since the file is
  already at the root) and corrected the stale `<root>/tests/test_...py` comment.
  The four pinned SHA-256 values were already correct and are unchanged; with
  the path fixed, all four subtests pass and the vendor pin is genuinely
  enforced.

### Notes

- No stored format changed and no shipped module's behavior changed; 1.0.2 data
  loads unchanged and there is nothing to migrate.

- This was purely a test-path arithmetic bug: the vendored files, their pinned
  digests, and the test's comparison logic were all correct. Only the directory
  the test looked in was wrong.

- The 1.0.1 security caveats are unchanged and still apply: BSR2 is unreviewed
  research crypto, the package custody chain is tamper-evident rather than a
  digital signature, and losing both a vault's passphrase and recovery code is
  unrecoverable by design.

---

## [1.0.2] - 2026-08-24

A CI, test-runner, and tooling pass on top of 1.0.1. No shipped module's
behavior changed — this release fixes the failing GitHub Actions workflow,
splits the test suite into fast and slow (real-KDF) runs so CI is affordable
again, corrects one test whose assertions did not match shipped behavior, and
trims `pyproject.toml` down to the only thing that actually reads it. No stored
format changed and no data migration is required.

### Fixed

- **GitHub Actions biometrics smoke job could never pass.** The `smoke` job's
  biometrics steps call `python app.py enroll ...`, which unlocks a local
  keyring via `getpass`. On CI there is no TTY, so `getpass` reads empty input
  and `Keyring.create("")` raised `passphrase cannot be empty` on the very
  first enroll — the job failed before exercising anything. Every
  keyring-touching biometrics step now pipes its passphrase in on stdin, the
  same pattern the vault steps already used. `make-samples`/`list`/`inspect`/
  `delete` do not touch the keyring and need no passphrase.

- **Wrong exception type asserted in `crypto/tests/test_rng.py`.** Two tests
  asserted `generate(0, ...)` and `generate(32, b"")` raise
  `Bsr2IntegrationError`, but `crypto/rng.py` does not wrap the vendored
  `BrisartDRBGError` (a `ValueError`), so it surfaces unwrapped. Both tests now
  assert `ValueError`, matching shipped behavior. (The alternative — wrapping
  the error in `rng.py` for API consistency with the rest of the layer — was
  considered and deferred; it would be a behavior change, not a test fix.)

### Changed

- **`run_tests.py` rewritten for explicit, fail-loud discovery and a fast/slow
  split.** The tree is pure PEP 420 (no `__init__.py`) and `conftest.py` is a
  pytest-only hook `unittest` never loads, so the old
  `unittest discover -s . -t .` was fragile (could silently collect nothing or
  error on import). The runner now discovers each `tests/` directory explicitly
  with the repository root as `top_level_dir`, adds the two root-level test
  modules by name, and **fails loudly on a collection import error instead of
  passing with zero tests**. New flags:

  - `python run_tests.py` — every test.
  - `python run_tests.py --fast` — everything except the real-KDF tests.
  - `python run_tests.py --slow` — only the real-KDF tests.

  Fast/slow is filtered at the **class** level, so a module holding both fast
  and slow classes (`test_keyring`, `test_factors`,
  `test_label_normalization`) still runs its fast classes under `--fast`.

- **CI workflow split into `fast` and `slow` jobs.** The ~75 real-BSR2-KDF
  derivations (`test_sealed_vault`, `test_file_records`, `test_batch_upsert`,
  `KeyringUnlockTests`, `FactorHashKdfRoundTripTests`) previously ran on **every**
  matrix Python (3.10–3.13) via `run_tests.py`, at roughly a minute per
  derivation — about 300 Actions-minutes per push. Now the `fast` job runs the
  full non-KDF suite across 3.10–3.13, and a separate `slow` job runs the
  real-KDF tests **once** on 3.12. Every test still runs on every push; the
  cost is just no longer paid four times over.

- **`pyproject.toml` trimmed to a ruff-only config.** This project is cloned
  and run in place (`python cli.py`, `python run_tests.py`) and is never built
  as a wheel or published, so the `[project]` metadata table was dead config
  and — worse — carried a hardcoded version that had drifted from `version.py`.
  The `[project]` table (and its duplicate version) was removed; `version.py`
  (`__version__`) is now the single source of truth, consistent with how
  `vault/` and `biometrics/` settings already import it. The `[tool.ruff]`
  configuration is unchanged except for one added `per-file-ignores` glob
  (`test_*.py`) so the two root-level test modules are covered like the ones
  under `tests/`.

### Notes

- No stored format changed and no shipped module's behavior changed; 1.0.1 data
  loads unchanged and there is nothing to migrate.

- The version bump exists to record the CI/tooling fixes; the application code,
  stored formats, and BSR2 construction are identical to 1.0.1.

- The 1.0.1 security caveats are unchanged and still apply: BSR2 is unreviewed
  research crypto, the package custody chain is tamper-evident rather than a
  digital signature, and losing both a vault's passphrase and recovery code is
  unrecoverable by design.

---

## [1.0.1] - 2026-08-24

A test-coverage and integrity pass on top of 1.0.0. No shipped module's
behavior changes — this release adds 204 new tests across 19 files, fills the
biggest coverage gaps left after the 1.0.0 restructure (the entire `crypto/`
layer previously had no direct tests), and **restores the vendored-BSR2 digest
pin that was dropped in 1.0.0**. No stored format changed and no data migration
is required.

### Added

**Direct tests for the `crypto/` layer (previously untested)**
- `crypto/tests/test_envelope.py` — seal/open round trips, length-hiding
  padding buckets, context binding (a ciphertext cannot be moved between
  contexts), uniform authentication failure on modified ciphertext / wrong key
  / wrong context, and the `MAX_PAYLOAD_BYTES` refusal. Uses a random 32-byte
  master key, so it exercises real BSR2 sealing without paying the KDF cost.

- `crypto/tests/test_keyring.py` — malformed-state rejection, the iteration
  floor **and** ceiling (0.8.0-beta), recovery-code formatting, and a small
  real-KDF unlock round trip (passphrase and recovery code).

- `crypto/tests/test_factors.py` — keyed-MAC bind/verify (fast), parse-time
  rejection of out-of-range iteration counts without running the KDF, plus one
  real-KDF hash/verify round trip.

- `crypto/tests/test_throttle.py` — regression coverage for the 0.8.0-beta
  corrupt-state hardening: `NaN`/`Infinity`/negative fields are discarded, a
  `NaN` `locked_until` no longer silently unlocks, and an astronomical
  `failed_attempts` no longer builds a giant integer.

- `crypto/tests/test_context.py` and `crypto/tests/test_rng.py` — context-string
  construction/rejection and DRBG output-length/independence checks.

**Coverage for the rest of the tree**
- `common/tests/test_common_utils.py` — atomic writes, hashing, and the
  timestamp helpers, including an explicit check that the `utc_now_iso` alias
  exists (its absence was the 1.0.0 import crash).

- `vault/tests/` — `test_record_model.py`, `test_record_ids_and_time.py` (the
  0.4.0 shared-timestamp rule), and `test_audit_log.py`.

- `biometrics/tests/` — `test_bulk_attachments.py` (multi-chunk + mixed
  file/folder bundling, missing-chunk detection), `test_device_key.py`, and
  `test_report_writer.py`.

- `packages/tests/` — `test_custody_chain.py` (including the 0.8.2-beta
  non-list `CustodyError`), `test_identity.py`, `test_package_audit.py`, and
  `test_verification.py`.

- `tests/test_cli_dispatcher.py` — the `cli.py` dispatch table, including that
  every documented tool (`biometrics`, `vault`, `package`, `gui`, `version`,
  `help`) is reachable.

### Fixed

- **Restored the vendored-BSR2 digest pin.** `tests/test_bsr2_vendor_integrity.py`
  is recreated: it SHA-256s every file in `vendor/` against pinned values and
  fails if any drifts, is edited, or an unpinned `.py` file appears. This closes
  the open item flagged in `README.md`, `docs/BSR2_INTEGRATION.md`, and
  `vendor/README.md` after 1.0.0 dropped the original test.

### Notes

- No stored format changed and no shipped module's behavior changed; 1.0.0 data
  loads unchanged and there is nothing to migrate.

- Most new tests use injected 32-byte keys or envelope-shaped fixtures so they
  run fast; the real-KDF round trips are isolated into their own test classes
  and are slow by design (~85 s per derivation), consistent with the existing
  sealed-vault and package suites.

- The 1.0.0 security caveats are unchanged and still apply: BSR2 is unreviewed
  research crypto, the package custody chain is tamper-evident rather than a
  digital signature, and losing both a vault's passphrase and recovery code is
  unrecoverable by design.

---

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-24

The first non-beta, production/stable release of **BrisartIdentityTools**.

This release is far more than a version bump over `0.8.2-beta`. Between the two
builds the entire repository was **restructured into a single flat tree**, three
brand-new subsystems were added (a desktop GUI, a full file/folder/drive
encryption layer, and a unified CLI dispatcher), a shared `common/` utility
layer was extracted, and a batch of defensive bug fixes landed. Every tool
directory was renamed and reorganized.

No stored format changed: vaults, identities, keyrings, templates, and packages
written by `0.8.2-beta` load unchanged. There is nothing to migrate.

---

### Added

**Desktop GUI (`gui/`)**
- **`gui/app.py`** — a single-window Tkinter desktop front-end covering all
  three tools (Vault, Biometrics, Packages) in one process. Standard library
  only (`tkinter` ships with Python), so it adds no new dependency. Every
  button calls directly into the existing service layer
  (`vault.store.vault_service.VaultService`,
  `biometrics.engine.enrollment`/`verification`, `packages.package`); no crypto,
  validation, or persistence logic is duplicated in the GUI.

  - **Vault tab**: choose/init/unlock/lock a vault, list records (works while
    locked), create records via a JSON payload editor, view/decrypt or delete a
    record, **plus** a new "Files / Folders / Drives" sub-tab for bulk
    encryption of any size.

  - **Biometrics tab**: create/unlock the keyring, enroll against
    voice/fingerprint/video files, verify a probe with an "any modality matches"
    option, inspect, delete, generate synthetic samples, **plus** a new "File
    Attachments" sub-tab.

  - **Packages tab**: create a package, add/remove recipients, open as a
    recipient, verify and display the custody chain, and run the same demo cycle
    as `packages/main.py demo`.

  - Every KDF-touching operation runs on a background thread behind a modal
    "Working..." progress dialog, so the window never appears frozen during a
    derivation that can take tens of seconds to minutes.

**Full file / folder / drive encryption**
- **`vault/store/bulk_file_service.py`** — `BulkFileService`: chunked
  encrypt/decrypt of content of any size, plus `upsert_paths()` /
  `restore_paths()` to zip any mix of files, folders, and drive roots into one
  bundle (preserving relative structure) before chunking past BSR2's ~16 MiB
  single-envelope limit. Reassembly verifies a whole-content SHA-256.

- **`biometrics/engine/bulk_attachments.py`** — the same chunking/bundling
  logic, biometrics-side, storing chunks as ordinary attachments plus a manifest.

- **`biometrics/engine/attachments.py`** — attach an arbitrary raw file (any
  extension, or none) to an identity, sealed under the same master key,
  byte-for-byte recoverable.

- **`vault/store/vault_service.py`** — new `upsert_file` / `upsert_file_bytes` /
  `get_file` / `get_file_bytes` methods to seal arbitrary raw bytes as a vault
  record (never parsed as JSON), with plaintext filename/size/SHA-256 metadata.

- **`docs/README_FULL_FILE_ENCRYPTION.md`** — documents the feature and its
  honest real-world throughput ceiling (BSR2 is ~1.4 KB/s in pure Python).

**Unified CLI dispatcher**
- **`cli.py`** — `python cli.py <tool> ...` launches `biometrics`, `vault`,
  `package`, or `gui` in-process, plus `version` and `help`.

**Shared utility layer (`common/`)**
- **`common/atomic_io.py`** — the single canonical `atomic_write_text` /
  `atomic_write_json`, replacing three near-identical write-then-rename copies.

- **`common/hashing.py`** — canonical `sha256_bytes` / `sha256_file`, replacing
  five pasted copies.

- **`common/timestamps.py`** — canonical UTC timestamp helpers.

- **`common/README.md`**.

**Other new files**
- **`version.py`** — single source of truth for the ecosystem version
  (`__version__ = "1.0.0"`), imported by both `vault` and `biometrics` settings
  so the two tools can never report different versions.
- New tests: `vault/tests/test_bulk_file_service.py`,
  `vault/tests/test_file_records.py`, `biometrics/tests/test_attachments.py`.
- New docs/READMEs across every subsystem (`crypto/README.md`,
  `packages/README.md`, `vault/README.md`, `biometrics/README.md`,
  `vendor/README.md`).

---

### Changed

**Repository restructure — every tool directory renamed and reorganized**
- `LabID_Beta/`            → **`biometrics/`** (reorganized into
  `codecs/`, `engine/`, `features/`, `identity/`, `reports/`, `samples/`,
  `config/`, `tests/`).
- `IdentityVault_beta/`    → **`vault/`** (persistence moved under
  `vault/store/`).
- `identity_bound_packages/` → **`packages/`**.
- `brisart_bsr2/`          → **`crypto/`** (BSR2 integration layer).
- `bsr2_vendor/`           → **`vendor/`** (vendored BSR2, byte-identical).
- The repository is now **one flat namespace-package tree (PEP 420)** with
  fully-qualified imports throughout; `brisart_bsr2/__init__.py` and other
  `__init__.py` markers were dropped. A single `conftest.py` /
  `run_tests.py` now drives every suite in one pass.
- `packages/crypto.py` → **`packages/ciphers.py`** (renamed to avoid colliding
  with the new top-level `crypto/` package).

**Versioning & packaging**
- Version bumped `0.8.2-beta` → **`1.0.0`**.
- `pyproject.toml` development-status classifier moved from
  `4 - Beta` → **`5 - Production/Stable`**; description and keywords updated to
  mention the GUI.
- `README.md` quick-start now documents `python cli.py gui` and the new
  restructured layout / commands.

**CLI surface**
- `vault/app.py` gained `encrypt-file`, `decrypt-file`, `encrypt-paths`, and
  `restore-paths` subcommands.
- `biometrics/app.py` gained `attach`, `attach-paths`, `extract-attachment`,
  `restore-paths`, and `remove-attachment` subcommands.

---

### Removed

- **`tests/test_bsr2_vendor_integrity.py`** — the digest pin that verified the
  vendored BSR2 files were byte-identical to upstream was **dropped during the
  restructure and not recreated**. Until it (or an equivalent digest check) is
  re-added, an accidental edit to `vendor/` will not be caught by CI. Flagged as
  an open item in `vendor/README.md` and `docs/BSR2_INTEGRATION.md`.
- **`LabID_Beta/core/scoring.py`** and **`LabID_Beta/core/template_engine.py`** —
  no longer present in the reorganized `biometrics/` tree.
- All `_beta` / `LabID` / `IdentityVault` / `brisart_bsr2` / `bsr2_vendor`
  directory names and their contents (superseded by the renamed trees above).

---

### Fixed

- **Timestamp import crash (`common/timestamps.py`)** — every consumer imports
  `utc_now_iso`, but the canonical module only defined `utc_now`. An
  `utc_now_iso = utc_now` alias was added; without it, importing any vault,
  biometrics, or packages module raised
  `ImportError: cannot import name 'utc_now_iso'` and broke all three tools.
- **Wrong sealed-envelope algorithm assertion in tests** — `test_sealed_vault.py`
  and `test_sealed_biometrics_flow.py` asserted the envelope `algorithm` was
  `"BSR2"`, but the real constant is `"BSR2-ARX-SPONGE-ETM"`. The old assertion
  always failed even though sealing was correct; both tests now assert the
  correct value.
- **CI invalid-identity-id smoke step (`.github/workflows/tests.yml`)** — the
  step meant to exercise path-traversal/invalid-char validation was passing a
  bad second positional argument, so argparse rejected the command before
  validation ran (the step passed for the wrong reason). It now uses the real
  CLI signature so the identity-id validation is actually exercised. A stray
  duplicate `tests.yml` at the repo root (which Actions never reads) was noted
  for removal.
- **Custody chain hardening (`packages/custody.py`)** — `verify_chain` now
  rejects a non-list chain and non-dict entries with `CustodyError` before
  iterating, instead of raising a raw `TypeError` on a hand-edited
  `"custody_chain": 123`. New regression tests cover both cases.
- **Unused imports (`packages/package.py`)** — removed `RecipientIdentityError`
  and `validate_identity_id` imports (never referenced) that failed the ruff
  `F401` lint job.

---

### Notes

- **No data migration required.** Every stored format, encryption scheme, and
  the underlying BSR2 construction are unchanged from `0.8.2-beta`; CLI and GUI
  usage can be freely mixed against the same vault/keyring/package files.
- The GUI is a **second way to drive the same application layer**, not a new
  one. Every security caveat in `docs/BSR2_INTEGRATION.md` still applies: BSR2 is
  unreviewed research cryptography, the package custody chain is tamper-evident
  rather than a digital signature, and losing both a vault's passphrase and
  recovery code is unrecoverable by design.
- The full file/folder/drive encryption removes the *architectural* 16 MiB
  ceiling via chunking, but the *practical* ceiling is now throughput
  (~1.4 KB/s in pure Python) — realistic for individual files and folders up to
  tens of MB, not for backing up a whole multi-hundred-GB drive.

---

## [0.8.2-beta] - 2026-08-23

One more defensive bug fix in the identity-bound package open path, in the same
vein as 0.8.1: a malformed custody chain crashed a boolean validator instead of
being reported as invalid. Latent — the normal create-then-open flow never
triggers it. It only fires on a hand-edited `.ibp`. No stored format changed and
no data migration is required. The fix is confined to
`identity_bound_packages/custody.py`.

### Fixed

**Identity-bound packages — verify_chain crashed on a non-list custody chain**

`verify_chain` is a boolean predicate, and 0.4.0 already hardened it so a
truncated custody event returns `False` rather than raising `KeyError`. But it
still iterated `custody_chain` without checking it is a list, so a hand-edited
package carrying `"custody_chain": 123` (or any non-iterable) raised `TypeError`
straight out of the function. Because the package `signature` does not cover
`custody_chain`, `verify_signature` passes first, so in `open_package` that
`TypeError` escaped uncaught instead of producing the uniform
`ValueError("Custody chain is broken or tampered with.")`, and skipped the
`DENIED ... reason=custody` audit event that every other denial records.
`verify_chain` now rejects a non-dict package, a non-list chain, and a non-object
event, returning `False` before iterating.

### Notes

- No stored format changed. Packages, identities, and vaults written by 0.8.1
  load unchanged; there is nothing to migrate.
- This hardens the code against corrupt and adversarial stored input. The 0.7.0
  security caveats are unchanged and still apply: BSR2 is unreviewed research
  crypto, the package `signature` field remains a shared-secret hash rather than
  a digital signature, and losing both the passphrase and the recovery code is
  unrecoverable by design.
  
---

## [0.8.1-beta] - 2026-08-23

Two defensive bug fixes in the identity-bound package open path. Both are
latent: the normal create-then-open flow never triggers either one. They only
fire on a malformed or hand-edited `.ibp` — a package missing a signed field, or
a payload that authenticates but is not valid UTF-8 — where the previous code
raised the wrong exception type and, in `open_package`, skipped the audit event
that every other denial records. No stored format changed and no data migration
is required. The fixes are confined to `identity_bound_packages/package.py`.

### Fixed

**Identity-bound packages — verify_signature crashed on a truncated package**

`verify_signature` is a boolean predicate, and 0.8.0 already hardened it to
report a package with a missing `signature` as invalid rather than raising. But
`_sign` reads `format`, `package_id`, `recipient_policy`, and `payload_hash` by
direct subscript, so a package missing any of those — a truncated file or a
hand-edited one — still raised `KeyError` out of `verify_signature`. In
`open_package` that escaped as an uncaught `KeyError` instead of the intended
`ValueError("Signature verification failed (package altered).")`, and skipped the
`DENIED ... reason=signature` audit event. `verify_signature` now rejects a
non-dict input and any package missing a signed field, returning `False` before
`_sign` is called.

**Identity-bound packages — a non-UTF-8 payload escaped the open pipeline**

In `open_package`, the payload was decrypted inside the guarded block but decoded
to text outside it, so an authenticated-but-non-UTF-8 payload surfaced as an
uncaught `UnicodeDecodeError` instead of the pipeline's uniform
`ValueError("Payload decryption failed (package altered).")`, and skipped the
`DENIED ... reason=decrypt` audit event. The decode now runs inside the guarded
block, so corruption is reported consistently and always audited.

### Notes

- No stored format changed. Packages, identities, and vaults written by 0.8.0
  load unchanged; there is nothing to migrate.
- Both fixes harden the code against corrupt and adversarial stored input. The
  0.7.0 security caveats are unchanged and still apply: BSR2 is unreviewed
  research crypto, the package `signature` field remains a shared-secret hash
  rather than a digital signature, and losing both the passphrase and the
  recovery code is unrecoverable by design.

---

## [0.8.0-beta] - 2026-08-23

A hardening pass over the BSR2 integration and application layers. 0.7.0 moved
every stored secret behind authenticated encryption; this release makes the code
around that encryption hold up when the values it reads back are hostile or
corrupt rather than well-formed. Every finding shares one theme: a persisted
value on the authentication path — limiter state, an iteration count, a stored
record — was trusted more than a file an attacker or a disk fault can edit
deserves. No stored format changes and no data migration is required.

Nothing in `bsr2_vendor/` is touched; it remains byte-identical and pinned by
`tests/test_bsr2_vendor_integrity.py`. Every fix lives in the integration or
application layer. The two behaviours that could hang or crash a process were
reproduced against the vendored primitives before and after the fix.

### Security

- **Attempt limiter no longer crashes or silently unlocks on corrupt state.**
  `AttemptLimiter._normalize` treated `NaN` and `Infinity` as valid numbers,
  because they are floats and `nan < 0` is `False`. A limiter state persisted
  with `locked_until` set to `NaN` made `locked_until > now` evaluate `False`,
  so a genuine lockout silently evaporated; and the subsequent
  `int(failed_attempts)` raised an uncaught `ValueError` out of a method whose
  contract is to raise `AttemptLockedOut` or return state, turning a corrupt
  state file into a hard crash on the unlock path. Non-finite fields are now
  discarded and read as fresh state, the same fail-safe already applied to
  non-numeric fields.
- **Attempt-limiter backoff can no longer be turned into a stall.** The backoff
  delay was computed as `base * 2 ** (failed_attempts - 1)` before being clamped
  to `max_delay_seconds`. Because `failed_attempts` comes from caller-persisted
  state, a stored count in the billions built a multi-gigabit integer that was
  then immediately discarded — a single `check()` measured at roughly 48 seconds.
  The exponent is now capped before exponentiation, so the clamp result is
  identical for honest input and the work is bounded regardless of the stored
  value.
- **KDF iteration counts are now bounded above as well as below.** 0.7.0
  validated the 10,000-iteration floor on read, to stop a tampered header from
  requesting a cheap derivation. It did not bound the ceiling. A stored factor
  hash or keyring header carrying an astronomical iteration count made
  verification or unlock run the deliberately slow KDF to completion — years of
  work — before the digest could even be compared and fail. Factor hashes
  (`factors.py`) and keyrings (`keyring.py`, on both the create and load paths)
  now reject an over-maximum count as malformed at parse time, so a tampered
  value fails fast without ever entering the KDF. The ceiling sits far above
  BSR2's 120,000 default, so no legitimate keyring or hash is affected.

### Fixed

**IdentityVault — batch upserts validated values too late to stay atomic**

`upsert_records` validated `kind` and `label` in its up-front pass but not
`value`, so a non-string value slipped through to the second, mutating loop and
raised from inside `build_plain_payload` — after earlier items in the batch had
already been applied to the in-memory vault and with the final save skipped, the
same failed-open, work-lost behaviour that 0.4.0 fixed for the missing-field
case. `value` is now validated during the prepare pass, so a bad item is
rejected before any record is mutated and the batch stays all-or-nothing.

**Identity-bound packages — malformed identity files raised a bare KeyError**

`IdentityProfile.__init__` read `identity_id` and `name` by direct subscript, so
an identity file missing either field raised a raw `KeyError` out of the
constructor, inconsistent with every other structural check in the class and
invisible to callers catching `Bsr2IntegrationError`. A missing field is now
reported as an integration error like every other malformed-file case.

**Identity-bound packages — a non-UTF-8 payload escaped the open pipeline**

In `open_package`, the payload was decrypted inside the guarded block but decoded
to text outside it, so an authenticated-but-non-UTF-8 payload surfaced as an
uncaught `UnicodeDecodeError` instead of the pipeline's uniform
`ValueError("Payload decryption failed (package altered).")`, and skipped the
`DENIED ... reason=decrypt` audit event that every other open failure records.
The decode now runs inside the guarded block, so corruption is reported
consistently and always audited.

### Notes

- No stored format changed. Vaults, identities, keyrings, templates, and
  packages written by 0.7.0 load unchanged; there is nothing to migrate.
- These fixes harden the code against corrupt and adversarial *stored* input.
  The 0.7.0 security caveats are unchanged and still apply: BSR2 is unreviewed
  research crypto, the package `signature` field remains a shared-secret hash
  rather than a digital signature, and losing both the passphrase and the
  recovery code is unrecoverable by design.

---

## [0.7.0-beta] - 2026-08-04

Encryption at rest, using real BSR2. Everything the repository previously stored
in the clear — vault record values, biometric templates, package payloads — is
now sealed with authenticated encryption. Still zero third-party dependencies:
BSR2 is standard library only, and it is vendored rather than depended on.

This release changes stored formats and refuses some previously readable files.
See **Changed** and **Migration** below.

### Added

- `bsr2_vendor/`: BSR2 vendored **byte-identical** from
  [BrisartSecurityResearch](https://github.com/JasonBrisart/BrisartSecurityResearch)
  at commit `656d962c447b7ac69d76b717820c34ae8e56b38a` — sponge primitives,
  authenticated envelope, DRBG, and OS entropy collection. No cryptographic
  primitive is implemented in this repository.
- `tests/test_bsr2_vendor_integrity.py`: pins every vendored file by SHA-256, so
  an upstream drift or a local edit fails the suite instead of silently changing
  what ships.
- `brisart_bsr2/`: the integration layer between BSR2 and the three tools.
  - `keyring.py` — master-key wrapping. A random 32-byte master key is sealed
    under a passphrase-derived key and again under an offline recovery code, so
    unlocking costs one slow derivation per session rather than one per
    operation.
  - `envelope.py` — seal/open with length-hiding padding (8-byte length prefix,
    256-byte blocks) applied inside the authenticated plaintext.
  - `context.py` — canonical context strings binding each ciphertext to the
    object it belongs to.
  - `factors.py` — factor hashing split by input entropy.
  - `rng.py` — DRBG seeded from `secrets.token_bytes` with transparent reseeding
    at upstream's lifecycle limits.
  - `throttle.py` — `AttemptLimiter` with caller-persisted state.
  - `errors.py` — one exception family; callers never import vendor exceptions.
- Offline recovery codes: 40 characters of Crockford base32 (200 bits), shown
  once at `init`. A second full-strength path to the master key, which is the
  price of being able to recover at all.
- `LabID_Beta/identity/device_key.py`: 32-byte local device key, created on first
  use with mode `0600` via `os.open` so it is never briefly world-readable.
  Refuses to overwrite an existing key, which would orphan every sealed
  template.
- `docs/BSR2_INTEGRATION.md`: full threat model — what each protection buys, the
  KDF cost reasoning, per-tool boundaries, and residual risks.
- New tests covering round trips, tamper rejection, context binding (a template
  sealed for one identity cannot be moved to another), keyring unlock failure,
  recovery-code unlock, iteration-downgrade rejection, and legacy migration.
  Repository total is now **111 passing tests**.

### Changed

- **Minimum Python is now 3.10** (was 3.9). Vendored BSR2 uses `int | None` in
  annotations that Python evaluates at import time, so 3.9 fails to import the
  envelope module. Patching the vendored file would break byte-identical
  vendoring and the digest pin in `tests/test_bsr2_vendor_integrity.py`, so the
  floor moved instead. CI covers 3.10 through 3.13.
- **Vault record values are sealed** under the vault master key. Record shells
  (`record_id`, `kind`, `label`, timestamps) stay readable so `list` and `verify`
  work while locked — a deliberate metadata trade-off, documented rather than
  implied.
- **Biometric templates are sealed** under the device key and bound to identity
  id plus modality. Template format is now
  `brisart-identity-tools/labid-template/v2`.
- **Package payloads are sealed** under a random per-package content key, which
  is itself wrapped once per recipient. Consequence: creating a package requires
  every recipient's identity unlocked at creation time, because BSR2 is
  symmetric and there is no public-key path without a dependency.
- Factor hashing replaced unsalted single-pass SHA-256, which leaked shared
  secrets through identical digests and fell to GPU guessing. Low-entropy inputs
  now use BSR2's slow KDF; high-entropy inputs use a keyed MAC, because
  stretching them adds nothing while a fast digest on a passphrase is a real
  weakness.
- Package verification runs cheap structural checks before expensive factor
  verification, so a tampered package is rejected without paying for a
  derivation.
- `IdentityProfile`'s keyring is now built lazily, so an identity that only ever
  adopts a master key directly is no longer forced to carry and validate a
  keyring it never uses.
- Renamed `test_plaintext_vault.py` → `test_sealed_vault.py` and
  `test_plaintext_labid_flow.py` → `test_sealed_labid_flow.py`; both previously
  asserted that data was readable on disk.
- `.gitignore` now excludes `device_key.json`, `*.identity`, `*.ibp`, and runtime
  `data/` directories. A device key decrypts every template beside it.
- CI smoke job sets `IDENTITY_VAULT_PASSPHRASE` and raises its timeout, since the
  vault and package CLIs each pay a real KDF.
- README's security model rewritten: what is encrypted, and what is explicitly
  not protected.

### Security

- Every sealed object is bound to a context string, so a ciphertext cannot be
  moved between records, identities, modalities, or recipients. A moved envelope
  fails authentication instead of decrypting into the wrong slot.
- Authentication failures are uniform: modified ciphertext, wrong key, and wrong
  context are indistinguishable to the verifier and reported identically.
- Keyring iteration counts are validated on read, so a tampered header cannot
  request a cheap derivation.
- Ciphertext length no longer reveals plaintext length beyond a 256-byte bucket.
- Digest comparison is constant-time.
- **Unchanged:** the package `signature` field is still a shared-secret hash, not
  a digital signature. It detects alteration; it does not prove origin.
- **Unchanged:** BSR2 is unreviewed research crypto. Upstream's `SECURITY.md`
  says not to use it as the sole protection for credentials, identity records, or
  recovery secrets. That caveat is inherited, not softened.

### Migration

- Legacy plaintext **vaults** load and are migrated to sealed storage on first
  write.
- Legacy plaintext **templates** load, flagged
  `storage_protection: unprotected_legacy_plaintext`, and are re-sealed on next
  write.
- Pre-BSR2 **packages are refused**, not opened. Their payloads were never
  encrypted and there is no key to recover; they must be re-created.
- Expect roughly a minute per passphrase unlock, and about three minutes for
  `init` (it derives both the passphrase and recovery wrappers). The KDF is slow
  on purpose; this is not a hang.
- **Losing both the passphrase and the recovery code is unrecoverable by
  design.**

---

## [0.6.0-beta] - 2026-08-02

Video FaceID, with liveness as an enforced gate. Still zero dependencies: the
AVI container is parsed and written by hand with `struct`.

### Added

- Uncompressed AVI support in `LabID_Beta/core/video.py`: RIFF chunk walking,
  `hdrl`/`strf` stream-format parsing, 8-bit palette and 24-bit BGR frame
  decoding, bottom-up and top-down row order, per-row stride padding,
  interleaved `rec ` records, plus a writer used to generate samples and to
  prove the reader against bytes this module laid out itself.
- `probe_avi_grayscale` for reporting resolution and frame count.
- Video FaceID templates in `LabID_Beta/core/video_features.py`: key-frame
  selection, per-frame face descriptors aggregated across the clip, and
  frame-to-frame motion statistics.
- A `video` modality wired through enroll and verify, inferred automatically
  from an `.avi` extension.
- **Liveness gate.** A recording of a still photograph scores a near-perfect
  face match, so liveness is enforced as a pass/fail gate rather than blended
  into the similarity score. A static clip returns `LIVENESS_FAILED` even when
  its face score clears the threshold. `--allow-static` overrides the gate and
  reports the raw score.
- Static-recording enrollment is refused by default, so a photograph cannot be
  baked into a template and make the verification-time gate meaningless.
- `record-video` CLI command: assembles two or more same-size PGM/PNG frames
  into an AVI recording usable for enrollment or verification. Camera capture
  needs a platform-specific driver, which would mean a dependency, so the
  recording path starts from frames already on disk.
- `probe-video` CLI command.
- 4 video demo samples: a live enrollment clip, a matching clip, a
  different-subject clip that also moves, and a static photo replay.
- 18 new tests (15 codec/template/liveness, 3 end-to-end video flow),
  including an AVI assembled byte by byte inside the test so a matching bug in
  both the reader and the writer would still be caught. Repository total is now
  **91 passing tests**.

### Changed

- Verification reports carry a `liveness` block and a
  `candidate_video_sha256`, and `result` can now be `LIVENESS_FAILED`.
- The "far" video sample genuinely moves, so it exercises a face-score
  rejection instead of being stopped by the liveness gate first.
- `test_samples_are_written_to_the_requested_directory` no longer asserts an
  exact sample count, which broke on every new modality; it now checks that all
  four sample formats are present and that every file lands in the requested
  directory.
- CI smoke tests exercise video FaceID, the recording round trip, the photo
  replay rejection, and the static-enrollment refusal plus its override.

---

## [0.5.0-beta] - 2026-08-02

LabID now supports three stdlib-only biometric modalities instead of just the
original grayscale face path.

### Added

- Real PNG support in `LabID_Beta/core/png.py`: chunk parsing, CRC validation,
  zlib decompression, all five PNG scanline filters, and grayscale conversion
  for grayscale, RGB, RGBA, grayscale+alpha, and indexed images.
- Real WAV PCM support in `LabID_Beta/core/wave_tools.py`: 8/16/24/32-bit
  decode, stereo-to-mono downmix, and 16-bit mono output, all without `audioop`
  so the code still runs on Python 3.13.
- Pure-Python DSP in `LabID_Beta/core/dsp.py`: framing, Hann window, radix-2
  FFT, power spectrum, mel filterbank, DCT-II / MFCCs, RMS, zero-crossing rate,
  and autocorrelation pitch estimation.
- Voice templates and verification based on MFCC summary statistics, pitch,
  energy, and zero-crossing rate.
- Fingerprint templates and verification based on normalized intensity,
  orientation/coherence fields, and minutiae-like ridge ending / bifurcation
  proxy grids.
- Multi-modal LabID dispatch so enroll/verify now handle `face`, `voice`, and
  `fingerprint` through one CLI.
- Demo samples for all three modalities: face PGM/PNG, voice WAV, and
  fingerprint PNG.
- 4 new LabID regression/integration tests. Repository total is now 73 passing
  tests across the three suites.

### Changed

- LabID face templates now accept PNG as well as PGM.
- Verification reports now record generic candidate source hashes plus
  modality-specific image/audio hashes.
- Fingerprint uses a stricter default threshold (`0.975`) than face/voice
  (`0.94`), because its score geometry is tighter and should not be forced into
  the same threshold bucket.
- CI smoke tests now exercise face PNG, voice WAV, and fingerprint PNG flows.

---

## [0.4.0-beta] - 2026-08-02

First release where "beta" reflects the state of the code rather than a label.
Every fix below was reproduced against the previous code before being changed,
and each one has a regression test that fails without the fix.

### Fixed

**IdentityVault — duplicate records from label normalization**

Stored labels pass through `safe_label()`, which collapses internal runs of
whitespace. Lookups compared against `label.strip()`, which does not. Any label
containing a double space therefore never matched an existing record, so
duplicate detection failed open and `upsert_record` appended a new record on
every call instead of updating in place. `get_record_by_label` then raised
`KeyError` for a label that was visibly present in the file.

**IdentityVault — batch writes were not atomic**

`upsert_records` mutated the in-memory vault as it walked the batch and saved
only at the end. An invalid item at position N raised after items 0..N-1 had
already been applied, and because the save never ran the caller silently lost
that work with no indication of how far the batch got. All items are now
validated before anything is mutated. Missing `kind`, `label` or `value` fields
are also reported explicitly instead of raising `KeyError`.

**LabID — identity ids silently collapsed onto one another**

`safe_identity_id` stripped disallowed characters instead of rejecting them, so
`ja/son`, `ja son` and `ja*son` all became `jason`, and `../../etc/passwd`
became `etcpasswd`. Since the id builds the record and template filenames, two
distinct identities silently shared one record and one biometric template.
Invalid ids are now rejected with the offending characters named, and there is a
length limit.

**LabID — re-enrollment destroyed the existing template**

`enroll_identity` wrote the identity record and biometric template with no
existence check, so enrolling an id that already existed replaced both without
warning and destroyed the only stored copy of that identity's template.
Re-enrollment now fails unless `--overwrite` is passed.

**LabID — generated samples were written to the current directory**

`make-samples` wrote its PGM files into whatever directory the CLI happened to
be invoked from, which scattered artifacts and made them easy to commit by
accident. They now go to `data/samples/`.

**LabID — storage paths could not be reconfigured**

Modules imported `IDENTITY_DIR`, `TEMPLATE_DIR` and `REPORT_DIR` into their own
namespace at import time, which froze the storage location on first import.
Paths are now resolved through the settings module at call time.

**LabID — new records claimed to be updated before they existed**

`build_identity_record` called `utc_now()` separately for `created_at` and
`updated_at`. The two calls can straddle a second boundary, making a brand-new
record look like it had already been modified. Both fields now share one
timestamp.

**Identity-bound packages — digest comparisons were not constant time**

Passphrase, voice, face, fingerprint, signature, payload and custody-chain
checks all compared SHA-256 digests with `==`, which short-circuits at the first
differing character and leaks how much of a guess was correct through timing.
All of them now use `hmac.compare_digest` via `crypto.digests_equal`.

**Identity-bound packages — malformed input crashed the validators**

`verify_signature` raised `TypeError` on a package with no `signature`,
`verify_chain` raised `KeyError` on a truncated custody event, and
`identity_authorized` raised `KeyError` on a package with no
`recipient_policy`. Functions whose contract is to return a boolean now report
invalid input as invalid.

**Identity-bound packages — unopenable packages could be created**

`create_package` accepted an empty recipient list, an unknown mode, a
non-string message, and a `THRESHOLD` count outside the recipient range,
producing packages that no identity could ever open. These are now rejected at
creation time.

**Identity-bound packages — importing a module created directories**

`identity.py`, `package.py` and `audit.py` called `mkdir` at module scope, so
merely importing them left untracked `identities/`, `packages/` and `logs/`
directories in the working tree. Directories are created when something is
actually written.

**Repository — the test suites could not be run**

`IdentityVault_beta/tests` failed with `ModuleNotFoundError` from the repository
root and `ImportError: Start directory is not importable` from inside its own
directory, so the suite could not be executed at all. Package markers and a
`conftest.py` now make every suite importable from either location.

### Added

- `run_tests.py`, a single entry point that runs all three suites. The three
  application trees use different import roots, so no one `unittest discover`
  call could collect them.
- 65 regression tests across the three suites (73 total, all passing) covering
  every fix above. The repository previously had 8 tests, neither suite of which
  could actually be executed.
- GitHub Actions CI: the full suite on Python 3.9 through 3.13, a `ruff` lint
  job, and a smoke-test job that exercises the real CLI paths end to end
  (enroll, verify, refused re-enrollment, refused duplicate label, package demo)
  and fails if the tests leave artifacts in the working tree.
- `pyproject.toml` with project metadata and a `ruff` configuration selecting
  the rule families that catch real defects.
- `utc_stamp()` replaces an unused `local_stamp()` helper that returned a naive
  local timestamp.

### Notes

Storage in this beta is plaintext by design. These tools provide
identity-based authorization, integrity checking, custody tracking and audit
logging, not confidentiality. Factor hashes are unsalted single-pass SHA-256,
which is fine for a workflow demo and not a secure credential store; a
production version needs a slow salted KDF such as Argon2 or scrypt, along with
protected biometric templates and liveness detection.
