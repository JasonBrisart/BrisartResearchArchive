"""Synthetic sample generation for testing and demos.

Real biometric captures require real hardware (a microphone, a fingerprint
scanner, a camera). To exercise enrollment and verification without any of
that, this module deterministically generates PGM images, WAV audio, and
BRVID video from a seed string -- the same seed always produces the same
sample, and two different seeds produce visibly/audibly different samples,
which is exactly what the test suite and the CLI's "make-samples" command
need: reproducible positive and negative test fixtures with zero external
dependencies (no camera, no microphone, no image/audio library).

None of this is meant to resemble a real fingerprint, voice, or face. It is
patterned synthetic data sized and shaped like the real thing, sufficient to
drive the feature extractors end-to-end.
