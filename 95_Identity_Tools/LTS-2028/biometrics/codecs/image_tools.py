"""Pure-Python grayscale image manipulation used to prepare template inputs.

Every biometric template in this project is ultimately a fixed-size grid of
values derived from a variable-size input (a captured image, a decoded video
frame). These functions do the two things every feature extractor needs
before it can compute anything: get the image to a known size, and reduce it
to a ``grid_size x grid_size`` block-mean summary. No third-party imaging
library is used; everything here is nested-loop arithmetic over flat
``bytes``.
