"""Fingerprint feature extraction: a grayscale image reduced to a ridge-
orientation summary vector.

Real fingerprint matching systems use minutiae extraction (ridge endings and
bifurcations located precisely in the image). That is a substantially more
complex pipeline than a dependency-free, auditable implementation can
responsibly cover. This module instead computes a coarser but still
meaningful summary: local ridge-orientation and ridge-density estimates over
a fixed grid, derived from Sobel gradients. It is a legitimate, well-known
class of fingerprint descriptor (orientation-field based), just not a
minutiae-based one.

The output is a fixed-length vector regardless of input image resolution.
