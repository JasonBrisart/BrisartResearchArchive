# Framework Verification Protocol
## Brisart Research Archive  

This document defines the protocol used to verify the internal consistency, structural validity, and cross-framework coherence of frameworks within the Brisart Research Archive.

The purpose of this protocol is to ensure that all frameworks released into the archive are not only individually complete, but also compatible with the broader system architecture and capable of producing consistent interpretations under aligned conditions.

---

## 1. Structural Verification

Each framework must be verified against its declared structure.

This includes:

- All components are explicitly defined  
- Input/output relationships are consistent  
- No implicit or undefined processes are present  

Verification requirement:

> Every described behavior must map directly to a defined component or interaction.

Failure condition:

- Behavior is described that cannot be traced to a specific component or dynamic relationship  

---

## 2. Dynamic Consistency

Each framework must produce coherent system dynamics under defined conditions.

This includes:

- Stable state transitions across iterations  
- No contradictory updates under identical inputs  
- Consistent behavior across repeated execution conditions  

Verification requirement:

> The same input conditions must yield structurally consistent system behavior.

Failure condition:

- Divergent behavior occurs without defined cause (e.g., parameter change or contextual input difference)

---

## 3. Parameter Mapping Consistency

All parameters must correspond to observable or definable quantities.

This includes:

- Clear mapping from parameter → observable  
- Separation of overlapping variables  
- Avoidance of implicit or hidden parameter interactions  

Verification requirement:

> Each parameter must be independently interpretable and derivable from observable system behavior.

Failure condition:

- Parameters cannot be isolated or require overlapping explanations  

---

## 4. Constraint Integrity

Each framework must operate strictly within its defined bounds.

Verification includes:

- Scope limitations are respected  
- Excluded processes are not implicitly introduced  
- Boundary conditions are enforced during interpretation  

Verification requirement:

> Framework outputs must remain within declared domain and assumptions.

Failure condition:

- Framework is applied beyond its defined scope or produces unsupported inferences  

---

## 5. Cross‑Framework Compatibility

Frameworks must be compatible with the broader archive architecture.

This includes:

- Alignment with shared input/output structures  
- No contradiction between framework-level claims  
- Consistent interpretation of overlapping variables  

Verification requirement:

> No framework should produce outputs that invalidate the core assumptions of another framework when applied under equivalent conditions.

Failure condition:

- Conflicting predictions or incompatible interpretations across frameworks  

---

## 6. Behavioral Coherence

Framework behavior must be consistent with defined mechanisms.

This includes:

- Observed patterns must align with declared dynamics  
- No unexplained emergent behavior beyond defined structure  
- Behavioral outputs must be reproducible at a structural level  

Verification requirement:

> Behavioral outcomes must be explainable through defined components and system dynamics.

Failure condition:

- Observed behavior cannot be explained by the framework’s internal structure  

---

## 7. Empirical Alignment (Abstract)

Frameworks must be consistent with observed or testable patterns.

This includes:

- Alignment with known behavioral patterns  
- Compatibility with defined experimental paradigms  
- Ability to produce testable predictions  

Verification requirement:

> The framework must not contradict observable patterns without providing a testable alternative explanation.

Note: Full empirical validation is not required at the public layer. This criterion ensures structural compatibility with observed behavior without exposing implementation-specific datasets or configuration.

---

## 8. System-Level Coherence

The archive must function as a unified system.

Verification includes:

- Alignment between:
  - Framework Construction Method  
  - Completion Criteria  
  - Architecture definitions  
- Consistency between:
  - public framework descriptions  
  - internal development artifacts  
  - execution assumptions  

Verification requirement:

> All components of the archive must describe the same system from different layers without contradiction.

Failure condition:

- Discrepancies exist between:
  - how frameworks are built  
  - how they are described  
  - how they are expected to behave  

---

## Verification Outcome

A framework or system passes verification when:

- All structural, dynamic, and behavioral checks are satisfied  
- No internal contradictions exist  
- Cross-framework consistency is maintained  
- All observable behavior can be traced to defined mechanisms  

Frameworks or systems that fail any verification stage must be revised prior to release.

---

## Functional Summary

The verification protocol ensures that the Brisart Research Archive remains:

- Structurally consistent  
- Dynamically coherent  
- Empirically aligned at the abstract level  
- Architecturally unified  

This protocol operates independently of implementation-specific detail and provides a consistent standard for validating both individual frameworks and the archive as a whole.
