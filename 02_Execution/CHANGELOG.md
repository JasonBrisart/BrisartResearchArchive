## [0.4.6] - 2026-08-16

### Added
- **Open Folder button** on the System page, next to Browse. Opens the
  currently configured output directory directly in the OS file explorer
  (`os.startfile` on Windows, `open` on macOS, `xdg-open` on Linux).
  - Falls back to the default output folder if the configured path is blank
    or unreadable.
  - Creates the folder first if it doesn't exist yet, so this never silently
    fails on a fresh install.
  - New `SystemController.open_output_folder()` in `controllers/system_controller.py`.
  - Button placed in `gui/pages/system_page.py`, directly under Browse.
